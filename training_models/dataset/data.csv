"Between 1995 and 2010, a study was conducted representing the percentages of people born in Australia, versus people born outside Australia, living in urban, rural, and town. First, in 1995, cities represented the major percentage of habitat by roughly 50 percent, followed by rural areas and towns came in last, among people born in Australia. On the other hand, people born outside Australia, cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent, followed by rural areas and towns. In 2010, among people born in Australia, cities had an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and a major decrease in towns and rural areas. Conversely, people born outside Australia, cities had the most percentage among both studies, followed by rural areas and towns."
"Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries."
"The left chart shows the population change happened in Austrilia from 1995 to 2010. In 1995, half of the people born in australia are from cities, 30% from rural areas and only 20% are from towns. For the people outside of Australia, most of the people still born in cities, which is around 60%. but the number of rural areas increased to 40% with the towns born rate decreased to only 10%.
In 2010, The people born in cities increased significianly in both in and outside Australia, especially in outside Australia, which reached 80%. The people bore in towns decreased simutanuously, to around 17% of the people born in Australia and 10% of outside Australia respectively. The most significiant change happened at rual areas numbers. It has shrinked to 17% of people born in Australia, and only around 5% of peopel bore outside Australia.
Overall, the chart shows us the trend that many people moved to Cities from rual area in the past 15 years."
"Human beings are facing many challenges nowadays. Poverty is always an critical topic among countries, especially the poverty in developing countries. Developed countries frequently offer financial support to poor countries but the poverty still exist. Experts are arguing that developed countries should consider other solutions to help solve the poverty issue. I believe this is a much better direction compare to money support only.
Money is essential to many factors like food, contruction and hospital. With money provided by developed countries, govenment can improve the inforstructure, supporting poor family with food, building more houses for the poor people, builing more schools to support children's education, which is critical for people to get out of poverty.
But money cannot solve everything. The poverty caused by many reasons like lacking of resource and experienced governor. None of them could be solved by simply offering money to the goverment. Besides, money could cause a bad habit to the governor, they may reply on the financial support too much. If the financial support ended someday, which could happen anytime in the current circurmestance, it will cause big trouble again.
Devevloped countries should focus on a sophicated solution instead of just providing money. For example, they can help poor countries to build manufacturing industry, and give certain subsides for the customer who buy directly from them. Developed countries also can send experienced instructor to help governer in poor countries build a better government system to improve the efficiency of governance, authority of justice, to make sure company feel safe to invest in these developing counties, which could have a long term benifit for the people there.
Overall, I am agree that money could help to solve the poverty but without other support from different functions, it may not the best solution for poverty."
"Information about the thousands of visits from overseas to three different European natural places during 1987 and 2007 is provided in the given line chart.
Overall, it can be seen that the number of visitors increased significantly in the three places compared to the initial year. Although, visits to Europeans lakes demostrated more changes over the 20 years than its counterparts.
In more detail, the most steady growth was experienced by the visits to Europeans mountains. For example, from 1987 the number of visitors grew from 20,000 to almost the double 20 years later. Similarly, visits to the coast also rose after a slight fall in 1992, reaching almost twice as much since 1987, with 75,000.
Those visiting Europeans lakes subtantially increased over the years from 10 thousand to a peak of 75 thousand in 2002. Despite falling for about 25 thousand in 2007, the visitis to this place remained higher compared to 1987, with 50,000 at the end of the period."
"Whether countries should only invest facilities and training on their elite athletes in order to win international competitions or give the same opportunities for all remains a big discussion. In this essay I will explain both views and why I think participation for all is the way which brings positive consequences.
Those supporting the first view believe that the odds to win are only high if the countries invest specialised facilities on their top sportmen. This is because, only athletes trained to reach the highest performance guarantee high scores. For example, it is known that China sends only its elite sportmen to compete in the Olympics and statistically, they usually win numbers of medals.
On the other hand, those who support sports facilities and training for all athletes consider that non-top ones can also have great opportunities to succeed. For instance, Diego Maradona, a Argentinian soccer player, never played in a professional field, on the contrary, he was discovered playing in an old field located in a poor village. This means that by providing facilities for all, gifted sportmen might be discovered and they can make history too.
In my opinion, as a supporter of the second view, I believe that permiting everyone to train and use sports facilities is the best way to achieve international sports. For me, winning is as essential as participation. Besides, this way leads to find natural talents among the local population, which is inspiring for others in similar circunstances.
In conclusion, although the two positions have strong arguments. I think that the one supporting facilities for all people is the one that can bring positive developments to achieve sports events. Participation and inclusiveness may help to find gifted athletes among ordinary people."
"This graph depicts the changes in tourists visits between 1987 and 2007 to these three places in Europe. It's clear from the graph, that generally the coast area have the highest number of visitors all over the years.
According to what is shown in the linear figure in 1987 period visitors first place was the coast with 40 visitor and in seconed place was the mountains with half number of coast's visitors and the lakes became lastly.
While the statistics have been changed at 2002 , the lakes sharply increased to be the first place by reaching the highest number of it's visitors, and the coast is the seconed.
Finally at 2007 , the coast speedly increased to be most place having tourists and the lakes dramaticlly declined to take the seconed place. The rules switched between coast and lakes numbers.
To sum up , the linear graph describe a constantly change in mountains visitors numbers , and sharply changes in coast and lakes visitors numbers."
"Sports is an essential part to most of us , some of us consider it a lifestyle and others consider it a job or source of income , So it's a huge part in our live.
Building specialized facilities to improve and develop athelets levels it's kind of encouragment to this category of people , and it reflects enormous benefit to them. Either by providing to them the professional training or by make them ready to international competitions. But narrowing the attention of sports to a specific category and ignore other categories actually doesn't sounds a good idea.
Athelets consider as a important part of the community but the don't cover most of it, and other people have the right to have sport facilities that suits their level and everyone whatever is it beginner or professional can use it.
Sports is a public interest that doesn't include specific people in it, and it's important to all genders and all ages, so providing facilities to specific ones can end up with unfairness results. In other hand , providing this facilities to all public people will lead to increase in sport awarness and end up with more people having healthy lifesyle.
In conclousion , according to medical facts said that's doing sport daily and make it essence in your life decreases heart attacks and raise the life quality, specified just the athelets people with sports facilities is undesireable decision. In other hand , raising the number of gyms and sports areas will conclude with healthier society."
"The line graph illustrates the number of overseas tourists to three different areas in a European country (coast, mountains, lakes) from 1987 to 2007
Overall, it can be seen that the number of visitors has increased for the three categories of areas over the period given. Furthermore, in 2007 the highest number of visitors was reported on the coast at approximately 85 thousand. The second most popular areas were the lakes and last were the mountains.
In regard to the coast, we can see that the number of visitors from 1987 to 1992 decreased. However, from 1992 to 2007 there was a consistently increased number of tourists climbing to over 70 thousand visitors in the final year of analysis.
About the mountains, the number of overseas tourists begat at 20 thousand and has increased to reach over 30 thousand by 2007.
Finally, the lakes were visited by 10 thousand tourists in 1987 and rose significantly to reach over 70 thousand in 2002 and then decreased to 50 thousand by 2007."
"International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.
To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone."
"The graph provides information about the number of overseas visitors to three areas in a European country namely; the coast, the mountains and the lakes. The data compare figures recorded in 1987 until 2007.
Overall, the coast had the greatest number of visitors in the first year and will continue until the end of the study. Meanwhile, among the three locations, mountains were noted to be the least among the categories.
In detail, at the start of the year, the coast was noted to be the highest with 40 thousand visitors in 1987. In the succeeding year, it had slightly decreased to 35 thousand. However, it had a sharp increased in number in follwing years and reached almost 80 thousand visitors at 2007
The lakes were observed to be in lowest number of tourists who visited the location, at a number of 10 thousand in 1987, and this was followed by people who went to the mountains with 20 thousand visitors on the same year. However, in 1992 the two locations had identical pattern which rose up to over 20 thousand visitors respectively. The mountains had a slightly contuinuous increasing pattern throughout the remaining years ending with 35 thousand visitors. Meanwhile, the lakes continuous increased its number until 2002 with over 70 thousand visitors This figures, however, showed a drastically decreasing pattern with 50 thousand visitors at the end of 2007."
"Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.
Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.
In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.
In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike."
"The graph bellow illustrates the amount of travellers who travelled between 1987 to 2007 to three different locations (the coast, the mountains, the lakes) in a particular European country, we can see that over all the coast and the lakes had more visitors than the mountains.
The number of the coast visitors reached 40 thousands in 1987 then it declined to its lowest in 1992 by almost 35 thousand visitors and then it went up gradually to 75 thousand travelers in 2007.
While the lake visitors started from 10 thousand in 1987 and continued rising until it reached its peak in 2002 by over 70 thousand travelers, then it witnessed a severe fall and went down to 50 thousand visitors by the year 2007.
unlike the lake and the coast which had their ups and downs the mountain areas had a slowly steady raise of number of visitors which started by 20 thousand visitor in 1987 and reached to almost 35 thousand visitors in 2007."
"It is often argued that some countries invist in devolping highly specialised training centers to train its top athletes to achieve international sports, instead of facilitate and provide public training centers for everyone to use and to practice. In my opinion i think both ideas together can contribue a very successful achievement in international sports for the country.
Building highly specialised facilities by the country to train its top athletes can help the athletes to get an apropriate training, give them the chance to progress faster and to be qualified to win or host international compititions like olympics, for example if the country invists and build a large swimming center to train professional swimmers, it is highly likely for them to win and get medals in international compititions.
On the other side providing various sport centers for the public use will encourage people to train and practice all kinds of sports more which leads to gaining more athletes to represent the country, for example allowing and giving access to a young talented girls to practice their favorite sport like football, ice skating, bascketball and more will give them the apportinety to become a professional athletes who would benifit and represent the country.
In conclusion, i think both invisting in building specialised facilities to train the top athletes to win and host an international compititions, and invisting in providing sport centers for everyone to use to encourage and build more athletes could be benificial and counribue a highly international achievement in sports for the country it self."
"The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousands
Overall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.
In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.
In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately."
"There is some countries attain international sports by making and buliding unique specialised facilities to develop and improve top athletes, rather than providing sports facilities that anyone else can use.
In my opinion, i think that building specialised facilities to encahnce top athletes potential is essential and its such a positive development, i also think that any sports player must have a good body and eat healthy food, because a good physique can improve movement,stamina and strength etc specially in the sports that depend alot on the body as an exmaple football, basketball, table tennis, swimming etc, and healthy food helps the athlete to achieve the physique that he wants and give him even more power and activity.
builiding specialised facilities is important because they will train them specificly on certain things in order to make them the best, also they can focus on the athletes alone they are not going to be disturbed by people, every athlete with his coach, and that place only will be for the proffessnial athletes, as an example in table tennis professional players play in their clubs because they have the best enviroment to be better, they have amazing equipment such as the table the racket etc, and they have the coaches all over the place, and they can play with the players because they are all professional athletes.
additionally those player have to be very fit, all of the top players are in extremely good shape their legs are built of metal in order to help them move quick in the table and the muscules helps with stamina if they are strong they can play more without getting tired.
So yes the facilities are very helpful and crucial to reach the top and they have to follow a specific diet from the professional coaches."
"Information is presented in two pie charts which compare the amount of time, in percentage, that employees spent on six different activities in a country between 1958 and 2008.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that while each activity that working adults did experienced a wide variety of changes, working and sleeping were the most and the second most popular categories in both years respectively. In addition, the most significant change in employees’ behavior was travelling to work.
Turning to first main feature, working ranked first in activity that working adults spent their time on over the survey period, contributing to 33% in 1958 and 42% in 2008. Next, sleeping ranked second in the activity that employees did. In 1958 the amount of time that employees slept was an exact 32%, before decreasing slightly to a precise 25% in 2008.
Turning to another main feature, with respect to going out, the popularity of this activity decreased noticeably from a modest 19% in 1958 to only 6% in 2008. Nevertheless, there was also an increase of 5% in relaxing at home. In 1958 only 8% of working adults spent their time on this activity. After that the popularity of this activity rose to a modest 13% in 2008. The last key point to note is travelling to work which rose fourfold from a precise 2% in 1958 to an exact 8% in 2008."
"There is currently a material issue that while the majority of students are eager to learn business or art in university, there are only a few students who want to study science, leading to numerous negative effects on community. With respect to this matter, there are also a wide variety of factors that influence the decision of students to not study science subjects.
It is undeniable that there are many reasons why undergraduates avoid studying science. A classic example of this is that science is extremely difficult to understand. In order to fully comprehend a particular scientific phenomenon, students have to learn complex theories that cause the phenomena. Therefore, they tend to choose other subjects that are easier to understand. Another common reason is a small amount of salary for working in scientific fields. When student choose subjects to study at university, they tend to enroll in an area that they could make a lot of money from having that knowledge. Since science career does not offer high remuneration, student possibly prefer to study other subjects such as business which offers higher salary instead.
It is true that there are many negative consequences on society of having less undergraduates studying science. One clear impact of this is the decreasing in innovation. This is because scientific comprehension is a mandatory requirement for creating an innovation. Hence, having only a few people who understand science will inevitably hold the creation of modern innovation. Furthermore, the current environmental crisis, such as an increase in global temperature, would perhaps reach a point of no return. Since the crisis relates to environment which is one of scientific aspects, having a small number of attention from students would lead to less social pressure to address this crisis properly.
In conclusion, it is the fact that science is complicated and people who have scientific knowledge can make less money than those who are expertise in other areas, resulting in less popularity in learning about science for university students. Moreover, with the rise in this problem, this trend possibly suspends the creation of new innovation and deteriorate the current environmental issues, which are two most crucial matters for society."
"The two diagrams compare the proportion of time spent by adult workers in a specific country on different activities over a 50-year period, from 1958 to 2008.
Overall, it can clearly be seen that in 1958, adult workers divided their time roughly equally between work, sleep, and other activities. However, over the next five decades, there was a remarkable increase in working hours, a significant decrease in sleep time, and the total time allocated to other activities remained nearly unchanged.
It is surprising that adult workers spent almost the same amount of time sleeping (32%) as they did working (33%) in 1958. However, by 2008, they slept 7% less (25%) and worked 9% more (42%), which represents a remarkable increase in working hours. As a result, the time they spent at home for relaxation increased from 8% to 13%. In contrast, the time spent going out with friends and family declined dramatically by one-third, from 19% to 6%. The most striking change, however, was the significant increase in time spent traveling to work, which quadrupled from 2% to 8% over the 50 years."
"In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine."
"The pie graphs illustrate the amount of time spent by a working class on six different activities (working, relaxing at home, sleeping, travel to work, going out, and others interests) in a country in the year 1958 and 2008.
Overall, the percentage of time spent on all activities had increased in 50 years but going out with friends and sleeping shows a decrease in 2008 as compare to 1958.
In 1958, people spent one-third of the time working, which increased in 2008 by 9% and it remained the top priority among working adults. However, people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958, which was 2% though by 2008 people started spending 8% of their time commuting to work.
It is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one-fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time-consuming activity. On the contrary, in 2008, this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6% of the time. People also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32% to 25%."
"In this essay we will talk about why in so many countries students do not prefer to choose science as a subject in the universities. There are plenty of reasons for this problem and what effect does this have on society? This essay will suggest many reasons for this problem.
The main reason of this problem is lack of trained Math and Science teachers. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to persue science, They will develop Science and Math phobia. Due to which they will prefer to choose any other stream than science to pursue their higher education.
Eventually, this will effect society in many ways. If students stopped taking science as their majors, their will be shortage of doctors. Because of that, people will suffer from many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take science as their major there will be no placement of science teachers for the future generation. According to me, Government should take firm steps to stop this from happening. There must be some training or some programs to keep teachers up to date to enhance their teaching.This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I belive that government and teachers should take the responsibility to create the environment to learn these subjects in a fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for Science Subjects in coming future. Otherwise, it may have negative impact on society which will not be a good sign for any country."
"The pie charts illustrate the proporation of time cost by different activities for the working adults in a certain nation in 1958 and 2008.
Looking from an overall perspective, the percentage of time spent on working, relaxing at home and other interests or playing sports were increased in the given years. However, the time of other three activities consumed were decreased at the same time.
In terms of the events which experienced an increasement of time, the percentage of time of working rised 9 percent, up to 42 percentage in 2008 and become the most time-consuming activity. The activities of relaxing at home and other interests or playing sports were seperately increased 5 percentage and 2 percentage in terms of time consuming.
As regards to going out, travel to work and sleeping activities, they were all decreased in different percentage of time. The most noticiable one was going out with friends or family, which dramatically droped from 19 percentage to 6 percentage, approximately one third of the former proporation in 1958. As for the percentage of sleeping and travel to work, they were both declined over the given fifty years."
"Recently, more and more students choose to study finance, management or other subjects instead of science in university around the world. There are many reasons contribute to this phenomenon and this would definetely impose negative influences on our society.
In terms of the factors, the reason is mainly due to the job market. Firstly, we have to admit that the number of science job vacancies in the market is significantly lower than the other occupations, like the nurse, the accountant, the lawyer and so on. Besides this, the science is comparatively difficult than the other subjects. If you want to be a qualified scientist, you are more likely to spend more time on learning and researching, maybe three years more than the other subjects. So, very naturally, few people would like to take the risk of learning science.
However, science does play an extremely important role in our society. If not enough people study science, it may impede the development of the country. Science represents the future of our nation because it could help to improve the development of technology and then make new technologies into pratical products. A good example can be seen in the United States, which has experienced a huge development in science during the past decades and has created a lot of advanced products, such as the Microsoft and Artificial intelligence, which has bring great benefits to this country in return and make it become the most powerful nation in the world. In contrast, if very few people learning science, the nation may remain at a standstill and lose its competitiveness.
In conclusion, although few people want to study science, the government should take efficient measures to encourage the public to study this subject to help our society improving continuously in the long future."
"The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.
Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.
First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.
However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958."
"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.
In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists."
"The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.

First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.
However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958."
"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.
The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.
This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.
In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists."
"The pie graphs illustrate the amount of time spent by a working class on six different activities (working, relaxing at home, sleeping, travelling to work, going out, and other hobbies) in a country in 1958 and 2008.
Overall, the percentage of time spent on all the activities had increased in 50 years but going out with friends and sleeping. We can see that people spent more time relaxing at home and on other interests in 2008 compared to 1958.
In 1958, people spent one-third of the time working, which increased in 2008 by 9% and it remained the top priority among working adults. However, people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958, which was 2% though by 2008 people started spending 8% of their time commuting to work.
It is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one-fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time-consuming activity. On the contrary, in 2008, this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6% of the time. People also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32% to 25%."
"In recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for Science or Mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. There are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. In this essay, I will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.
The main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. STEM teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue STEM subjects, they will develop Math or Science phobia. Subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.
Eventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. Firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. Eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take STEM subjects in university, there will not be STEM teachers to teach future generation. According to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. There must be some training program to keep STEM teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for STEM subjects in recent future. Otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country."
"The provided picture illustrates how rain water is reclyced, processed and turned into drinking water in an Australian town.
Overall, information given from the diagram below depicts rain water is collected from the roof of the houses and then it passes through many different steps, each with its specific function, before turning back as drinking water into houses.
In particular, when it rains on steep roofs, water pours down on one side and it is therefore collected by a drain, which leads to a large underground pipe, connecting all houses. Water is then sent to a water filter, which roughly purify water from dust, pebbles and other bigger particles.
Subsequently, water is collected into a giant underground storage, waiting to be sent into the water treatment tank. In there, chemicals are added into the water to make it potable. Finally, drinking water is sent back to houses through a piping system."
"These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.
First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.
In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.
In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong."
"The process diagram below depicts how rain water is installed to be collected and then treated to finally be used as drinkable water in some town in Australia.
Overall, it is clearly can be seen that the proccess consists of five sequential stages starting from collecting rain drops to ultimatley be usable in houses.
Firstly, rain water slides into the drain from the house roof, through drains, rain water is shortly transffered to water filter, there where water is purified from pollutants and undesirable substances. After that, the filtered water goes through a pipe that leads to a huge square-shaped storage then immediatley go through another pipe to be treated. The water treatment includs chemical substances that are pumped to be mixed with water in order to be completly clean. After the box is filled to the top, purified water will be pumped to the house and ultimatley be utilized by human consumption."
"There's an opinion around the ideal way to encourage and teach youngesters how to develop cooperetion skills and that is through team sports at educational facilities. I completly agree with that opinion and this essay shall demonstrate some vital reasons to support my view.
A very important reason is that engrossing with teammates will naturally result in the evolvment in the infant's cooperation and cognitive skills. through sociallizing with other same-aged people, the child meets new children and encounter certain events that will make them acuire skillfulness regarding cooperation. For instance, some parts of the world pour their focus on including activities, in a context of teamwork, in the school curriculum due to the knowledgable fact that working as a group for the child not only it devolops teamwork skills but also the cognitive ones.
Experiencing failure and win will teach the offspring how to encourage their peers when they feel demotivated in order to reach a mutual goal, also how to share and demonstrate their appreciation in terms of winning a comptetion. I have obsorved my little brother when he plays in groups, noticeablly, he gets more motivated and happier when he wins alongside his team because he can express his gratitude and show sence of appreciation to his peers wich means he now developed coopreation skills.
In conclusion, despite the fact that involving in teamwork kind of activity will yield the advancement regarding cooperation and cognitive skills for youngesters, also encountering the results of a competition, whether it was failure or winning, will inevitably make them acuire skills to deal with such events that evenually make them better cooperatives."
"The graph illustrates the process of transforming rainwater into drinking water in a city in Australia.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that rainwater undergoes five sequential steps to become domestic tap water, ready to be used in the house.
Firstly, roof drainage is installed for the collection of rainwater. When it rains, the water moves along the roof drainage, and pipes lead into the water filter. Next, the water filter removes basic pollutants, such as leaves and sediments, and begins the first step of water purification. After that, the water flows into a large square water storage tank and then inflows to the next tank for treatment. When enough rainwater enters the treatment tank, chemical substances are injected through a small device on top of the tank to sterilize and ensure the safety of water quality. Once the water is fully purified, it is pumped into the house as a source of drinking water."
"Many people believe that the most effective way to teach children cooperation in teamwork is by encouraging them to join team sports at school. I completely agree with this idea and will give my reasons as follows.
Firstly, team sports require children to work together and practice communication in order to achieve a common goal. For example, in Taiwan, many schools have baseball lessons in sports courses, and some schools even have a school baseball team. In such courses, children can learn to trust one another and develop communication skills by playing. Furthermore, they can develop mutual understanding and compromise with their teammates in order to reach a common goal. In this way, they can develop their social skills, find a way to cooperate, and build positive relationships with their peers. As a result, team sports experiences will contribute to their social skills and social life as well.
Secondly, team sports can teach children the value of perseverance and resilience. Through the experience of competing with other teams, children can learn to accept the ups and downs of success and defeat and go through any difficult situations with their teammates. This is especially the case if they fail in a competition as they can learn to encourage each other and develop a sense of group belonging. For instance, we can see many touching stories in team competitions where despite being on the losing side at the beginning, the team rallies, and members encourage each other to restart. This can be a great lesson for children to build their resilience, self-confidence, and a sense of belonging, as well as develop a positive attitude toward their life in the future.
In conclusion, I believe that team sports provide children with opportunities to develop their social skills, increase their confidence and resilience, and ultimately benefit their whole life. Therefore, they should be included in the school curriculum for children."
"The diagram illustrates the way in which drinking water is produced from rain water.
Overall, converting water from nature into those for human daily use is a cyclical process that consists of collecting, filtering, storing, chemical treating and making the new product for reuse.
After falling from the rooftop, the water is collected by the gutter, following the direction in the drain underground. Once there, the water has to undergo the filter, which mechanically removes its impurities. This is the initial cleaning step for rainwater.
The water is then poured into a storage tank, waiting for the next cleaning experience. In this stage, it is transported to the water treatment. Chemicals are essential for this process as they will deeply remove the residue that cannot be washed by the water filter and make water fit for consumption. Finally, the water experiencing double cleaning process, is delivered to households for different daily utilization. And once it is used and becomes rain, it goes through the recycling process all over again."
"The ability to associate at school has been a great concern. Owing to this, some assume that the optimal way to boost children's collaborative spirit is through school team sports. In my opinion, teaming up in school sports would be problematic, and therefore, should be implemented in certain occasions, with certain individuals.
Initially, participating in team sports would put a tremendous risk in injuries. Inevitably, physical group activities require high-speed movements, resulting in harsh collisions. Students then may lose their interest in those activities, or hesitate to attend in order to avoid any kind of damage to their body.
Another point to consider is that joining team sports can effortlessly breed serious competition among teammates. Therefore, at that time, the objective of cultivating cooperation would be replaced by the desire for accolades in children's mind. This consequently spells trouble for the hostile environment as the feeling of inadequacy and low sellf-esteem in students are growing.
Finally, the best solution would be offering team sports as an optional project for students. To illustrate, a school football match can open more opportunities for those into soccer and accept to play in unity. In this case, participants may have a chance to immerse themselves in a joint effort after being thoroughly disseminated about the rules. As a result, they are still able to enjoy the game while working in a joint project.
In conclusion, boosting children association by teamsports may not be feasible for all of them, but operating more joint projects for those with passion and fair play is a much better approach."
"Information is presented in a diagram which depicts the main steps of rainwater treatment with the aim to produce drinking water in a particular town in Australia.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that the process involves a number of complex stages starting from collecting rainwater, purification until getting the water as a final product.
At the beginning of the process, rainwater is drained from a roof through a tube which is attached to each house. Then the water flow through the tube to a three-layer water filter which is the first step of water purification. After that, the filtered water is kept in a storage tank which is connected to a water treatment tank. As the water in the storage flows into the water treatment tank, it is mixed with chemicals, making this step as the final part of the process. Once the water is mixed, it flows from the water treatment tank to each house and is ready for drinking."
"There is currently a contentious argument that the most effective method for young people to learn about cooperation is by doing team sports, rather than other alternatives. Despite the fact that doing sports as a team could inarguably strengthen collaboration skills of children, I personally believe that there are also other vital ways to upskill them in this aspect.
It is true that doing team sports could possibly lead to the collaboration of children. A classic example of this is that they have to jointly cooperate with other team members in order to achieve the team’s goal. This is because reaching the goal in team sports requires each member to not only do their responsibility, but also to help other members to maximize the performance of the team. In addition, supporters of doing team sports may argue that children will also learn to communicate with other members, which is one of key factors for cooperation. As a result, when young people have better communication skills, they tend to be willing to collaborate with other people in any situation.
In spite of the aforementioned positive effects on juveniles with respect to the cooperation, the juveniles could also be encouraged to cooperate by working in a group as another alternative way. A common example of this is they have to think from other perspectives, which is an essential skill for collaboration. When juveniles work with other people, they would inevitably encounter with a wide variety of ideas which they might disagree with. Therefore, they have to understand the ideas from the others’ point of view in order to reach a consensus. Furthermore, another key point for cooperation that adolescents will learn is delegation. This is because tasks that a group has to complete might requires various knowledge. Hence, adolescents have to delegate each task to each group member based on the expertise.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that doing team sport will positively result in the collaboration of children since they would get exposed to situations, requiring them to help and communicate with other team members. Nevertheless, I totally disagree with the notion that team sport is the best way to teach children to collaborate since doing assignment in a group could also teach and motivate them to cooperate with other people in terms of thinking from other points of view and work delegation."
"The diagram illustrates collection and treatment of rain water which is later used as driniking water in an Australian town.
As shown in diagram, the rain water is first collected with the help of drainage pipes which is connected to the roof of several house. The water collected through these pipes is later filtered using water filter and stored in the storage tank beneth house.
There is channel which connects storage and water treatment plant which is placed adjectant to the storage tank. Water flows to water treatment tank from the storage tank and is processed real time with the help of chemicals. The structure is mount on the top of the water treatment tank which dispose chemicals in the stored water which is later used as driniking water in the houses of australian town.
To conclude, rain water is collected utilized as drinking water but is filtered twice before that to remove impurities from it."
"From many generations schools are consider as place where major behavior modifications and manners are bulid in a child. One of such important trait is cooperation which helps indiviual in many stages of life to acheive a collebration and goals. Nowadays, it has been taught in schools through several activities but latley the focus is inclined more towards team sports.
To begin with, lots of private and goverment schools do promote team sports such as volleyball, hockey etc. compare to indiviual sports as their are plenty of advantages which are associated with it. Studies have shown that such sports not only help childrens build strong bond among themselves, however it also inculcate other important traits such as disipline, leadership and planning to achieve common goal which can perhaps help them to stand out in society in future.
Additionally, it increase the confidence which is consider as vital quality in any human beign who wants to outgrow of any challanges which comes in his/her way. Students who give equal attention on sports while studying have somehow developed a better time managment trait compare to those who focus only on studies or sports.
On contrary, It has show certain disadvatages to the students who does not find sports as their primary area of interest and are introvert by their inent nature. When such childrens are forced to participate in team sports they either end up loosing their self- esteem or judged by their surroundings.
In conclusion, although their are lots of advantages of team sports at school but they should consider other activities as well which can interest students of all nature so no one feels leftout and all gets equal oppurtunities to participate in every activity."

"Information regarding the millions of overseas journeys from five different regions every five years from 1990 to 2005 is provided in the table.
Overall, it can be seen that the total number of international trips grew substantially over the 15-year period. Of those millions of travels, Europe represented the highest and the Middle East represented the lowest.
One of the most notorious characteristics of the table was the increase in the total of travels from 448.9 million in 1990 to 693.7 million in 2005. European travelled the most during the 15-years period, accounting for 400.2 million in 2005, accounting for around third-fifths of the total. Those in the Middle East went to overseas more too, but they remained with the lowest numbers from 9.8 in 1990 to 15.8 million in 2005.
In Africa, Asia and the pacific regions the international visits experienced growth during the 15 years. The former grew by 10,000 milion and the latter by more than the double in 2005. Similarly, those in America travelled more during the first 10 years, however, they experienced a slight drop of 5 million at the end of the period."
"Whether people should be encouraged more to study vocational courses due to the lack of workforce in that area or be encouraged to study at the university remains a big discussion. I believe both of these areas of study should be promoted equally, countries need academics as well as qualified workers.
One of the reasons that supports the encouragement to study either area, academic or vocational, is the worldwide need for the two types of professionals. For example, Australian government is currently offering work visas and permanent residencies to overseas qualified workers such as, carpenters, cooks, bar managers as well as doctors, nurses and psychologists. Essentially, this demonstrates that the two areas are equally needed and this happens in Canada and England too.
Another point to be considered is the increase in the people's needs due to the population growth, which, therefore, affects the need for more experts in all sectors. This includes professional from different fields, such as science, construction and even thinkers. If people is encouraged to study more in one field than others, this might be detrimental to societies, leaving one sector significantly more affected. Eventually, countries need a balance in the areas choosen for people to growth a career.
In conclusion, I support the idea of encouraging both, university and vocational studies. Many countries worldwide have expressed their need for the two types of workers. Besides, as the population is rapidly increasing, the need for experts in multiples areas is increasing too, so promoting both is the only way to maintain a balance."
"Information regarding the millions of overseas travels in five countries every five years from 1990 to 2005 is provided by a table.
Overall, it can be seen that travelling overseas increased in total over the years. In four of these countries the trend showed increases. Futhermore, Europeans represented the highest numbers of travels overseas, whereas Middle East represented the lowest.
The total number showed increases throughout the whole period. In 1990, 448.9 million people travelled abroad and at the end of the period it reached to 693.7 in total.
African travellers started with 18.2 million in 1990 and ended with 10.5 million more in 2005. Europeans followed with a same trend, from 280.2 to 400.2 million. Middles East went up from 9.8 to 15.8 million travels in 2005. Asia and pacific travellers also travelled more, starting with 60.2 million in 1990 to more than the double in 2005, 135.8. Americans also increased its number until 2000, from 80.5 to 118.2. However, it was the only country dropping the numbers a little for 5 million in 2005."
"Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.
Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.
Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.
In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area."
"The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.
It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.
In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.
In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.
Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers."
"In today's era, most students look forward to enrolling in professional courses at universities. However, some believe that authorities should encourage teenagers to take vocational courses as there is a huge shortage of professionals like electricians and plumbers. In my opinion, while there is a scarcity of such workers and the government should make special arrangements for prospective learners, certain other factors should also be considered.
Due to the insufficient work possibilities after completing vocational courses and extremely low wages, scholars are forced to take loans at high interest from banks to attend university programmes. An average adult has to pay more than 70,000 USD yearly for a typical professional course at a university, and most children are unable to accumulate sufficient funds in time, which forces them to borrow this amount from banks. The job market for plumbing and electrical work is highly unregulated, which leads to the exploitation of such workers by the established brands, further distressing the people. Some regulations should be established for these markets to decrease the risk factor for workers.
On the other hand, due to the continuing increase in our population, the demand for doctors, engineers, and professors is also rising. In recent years, governments from all over the world have reported the widening gap between the number of professionals available per 1000 people. For example, in India, there is only 1 doctor available per 50 people in urban areas, and the number is even more concerning in rural areas, where the figure of patients climbs even further.
In my opinion, authorities and universities should work together towards introducing scholarships and other benefits not only for learners of professional courses but also for peoples of vocational courses. Furthermore, better and more wages for plumbers and electricians could also be established to attract more students.
In conclusion, favourable policies should be implemented for qualified workers to attract more potential learners by the government, as well as lower tution fees for university attendees."
"The table compares the number of vistors who travel to five international regions during the period of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.
Overall, it is clear that the total number of people travelling in the five areas has gradually increased. Europe obviously received the highest number of vistors compared to the other four areas, while the number of vistors who went to Africa and Middle East are the two latest regions.
It is no doubt that the date of people who travel to Europe was the highest, with 280.2, 390.3, 393.2 and 400.2 million respectively in the four periods. At the same time, the number of people travelling to America took the second place, with 80.5, 112.5, 118.2 and 113.2 million respectively.
For Africa, the number of travellers took the fourth place, with 18.2, 20.8, 26.9 and 28.7 million respectively during the mentioned four years. Moreover, we can see clearly that the number of people who perfer to travel to Middle East was the lowest data, with only 9.8, 11.3, 13.5 and 15.8 million respectively."
"Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.
In conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people."
"The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.
Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.
Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis."
"According to some people administration should stop the sports that are risky, while few others have an opinion that individuals should have liberty to perform any kind of sports or activity. In my opinion critical sports should be stopped because it not only dangerous but harmful for others as it attracts youngesters.
Firstly, the sports activities which are risky, should be banned by the government as, they are the only ones who can actually stop this life taking so called adventure and put a full stop. Infact, people specially youngsters get affected as they get easily influenced and under peer pressure perform these tasks without any guidance or safety, for instance, road racing which is the major cause for accidents in many countries which not only effect them but the public arround, another example is Death's well where car drivers drive the car in a well in circular motion where their is no guarantee of life where at any moment people can die.
Secondly, everyone should have right to perform sports or activities according to their taste, however, safety is the primary concern that one should keep in mind. while stopping all the ones which can actually take a life should not be performed.
As a result, these dangerous events has various outcomes majority of the performers turnout to be handicapped or with broken bones. so guidelines and measures taken by government is necessary.
In conculsion, the risky sports activities should banned and government should only allow the events with keeping the risk in mind and the after effects of the activity that what influence will it have on people of diiferent age criteria."
"Given is the two charts illustrating the proportion of home-making involvement in males and females and their time spent per day on four different sectors in a country.
Overall, cooking not only recorded the largest ratio of the involvement in both genders, but also costed their time the most.
In terms of cooking, the proportion expended the highest amount of population's home immersion, at precisely 60% for men and over four-fifths for women each day, and the most significant amount of time they spent on, at an hour and nearly an hour and a half for males and females respectively. The next highest level belonged to cleaning, with 40% of male section of the society involving in, consuming three quaters of an hour when the ratio of female section accounted at 62% for the former and around 70 minutes for the latter.
What followed was the pet care category, in which women and men shared quite the same amounts on the chore attendance and time utilization. Both genders spent 20 minutes a day for this chore, with the immersion of just over a fifth of male citizens and exactly a fifth of female ones. Finally, the rates of house repair was exhibited the least considerable, in both concerning matters. When 19% of men spent just over a quater of hour for this sectors, one in ten of women involved in this task, with an insignificant amount of time spent per day"
"The increasing prevalence of furious sports has been a great concern. Owning to this, some assume that the Governments should abolish this type of sports while others contend that citizens should have a right to immerse in any activities, regardless of its high-risk characteristics. In my opinion, the policies ought to focus on participants's assurance instead of banning any sports.
On the one hand, the propose of prohibiting extreme sports should not be approved because it is against the democratic society. Inevitably, the participating in risky sports is one of residents' rights. As a result, the intervention of the Admistrations in this case will prevent them from their own interests illegally. Moreover, the extreme sports abolishment may extinguish carreers and dreams of numerous professional athletes and trainees. Therefore, banning is not a reasonable approach in this situation.
On the other hand, authorizing freedom in playing dangerous sports generates several matters. Understandably, participants mostly risk their health and lives being involved in these activities, from violence and physical injuries, which means the furious characteristics are posing a threat to their own existences. In addition, the prohibition on those sports can orientate hobby development for future generation on healthy sports, requiring less violence and intension. This, therefore, leads to a more tranquil community.
Finally, according to my perspective, the Administrations should attempt to handle safety assurance and enhance risk education in those players. Under this circumstance, the residents are equipped with protective support and still allowed to enjoy and follow their passion. This then would be the optimal way to meet residents' demand.
Conclusively, I personally believe the solution is not about whether the Governments should forbid furious sports activities, but about providing them protective assurance and risk acknowledgement."
"These two charts illustrate how many men and women are useed doing housework and also how many time they spend on it per day in one particular country. At the first glance, it is clear that the number of femails who are involved in some kinds of home tasks are higer than the figure of men houseworkers, while the percentage of time that people useally spend on this kind of work accounted as proporsionally simmelar.
The first chart depicts that women cooke and clean by 20 per cent more than men, but the latter repairs house more often than the former. Pet caring involve femails and mails approximately the same.
The second chart shows that the number of hours spending by citizens in there household is proportional with first chart figuers. Avarage time to cooking for instance is the same. 80 per cent of women spend 80 minutes per day for cooking. And above 20 per cent of men spend almost 20 minutes for house repairing every day.
Summing up, more women than men deffinately work harde in households in this country."
"This is true that some people are sure that civil servants should avoid harmful sport activites, but other part of sosiety thinks that individuals should have freedom to choice any sport that they like. I am in two minds on this, but probably governments should take care of their citizens and be responsible for human lives.
Firstly, extrem sports are very popular above young generation in all over the world and these kinds of activity are the huge part of pastime for thousands people. Risk's lovers spend planty of time and enormous amount of money to feel freadom and to try themselfs as a brave and strong persons. For instance, in my country such sports as rock jumping, mountain cyicling and BMX are very popular. And even if these activites are dangerous, young men and women are keen on it, and they are against the governments who wants to ban this sports.
On the other hand, adult people always want to protect younger ones. To my point of thinking protection is significant habbit of human beings that we need to respect. However, governments, who try to ban dangerous sports, need to be more flexible, and not only say no for harmful sports, but involve young generation in activites that are not so risky. I also belive that media attention can make seance about all cons of extrem choice, becouse information about number of death between exrem sportmens can be helpful.
Summing up, the buning dangerous sports topic is rather complecation and importaint issue. I suppose that, the sosiety need recive more information about harmful sports, while governments have to be more responsible in building anouth common sport facilities."
"The first chart illustrates percentage of males and females who do cooking, cleaning, pet care and repairing house. The second chart illustrates how much time they spent on the houseworks.
According to the first chart, while females are more dealing with the cooking and cleaning, males are more dealing with house repairs. On the other hand, percentages are quite similar when it come to the pet care. The second chart shows that females are spending more time on cooking and cleaning, while males are speding more time on house repairing, parallel to the first chart. Also it can be seen that males and females are spending equal time on pet care.
Males are approximately 20% less involved to the cooking and cleaning while females are approximately 10% less involved to the house repairs, based on the first chart. Also, it can be seen that females are spending extra 20 minutes while they are cooking, and appoximately extra 15 minutes while they are cleaning."
"From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.
Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.
Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.
Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa."

"According to the bar chart, all age group consuming five or more portions of fruit and vegetables are less than 35% in 2006. This is less than half of the total age group.
And from the total age bracket, we can conclude all female consumption of five or more portions of fruit and vegetables are slightly higher than the male consumption. In general woman tends to consume more fruite and vegetables than men. It start from 19-24 age group and around only 15% for male and slightly higher for female reached the recommended amount. However both cosuming at the same level at 75 age group.
The highest amount of fruit and vegetables consumed by men and female is the same at the age group 55-64. We can conclude at this age 55-64, both male and female consumed the most fruit and vegetables. For male is above 30% and almost reaching 35% for the female."
"In developed country, economic wealth is not an issue for them. Some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. I partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. However money is still the driving force to well-beings.
The statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. Economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. However, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. These are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. Degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.
On the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. For government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. For examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. Secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. The military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. Thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. If we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.
In conclusion, I believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth."
"This bar graph illustrate fruit and vegetables consumption per a day in each age group in UK. The bar chart shows the percentage of men an women consuming five or more parts either fruit or vegetables in 2006.
The data clearly despicts that females have a higher percentages of all age groups. In terms of age from 19 to 24 the females have over than 15% of consumption while the males have exactly 15% whitch the lowest percentages in the chart.
On the other hand, the age group 55-64 have the highest fruit and vegetables taking among all groups, where the females nearly 35% and males more than 30%.
The age 75 of both are similar in
Overall we could say that the males back in 2006 have had decrease fruit and vegetables intake than females."
"There is no denying the fact that the main purpose of increase economic wealth is arguable.
While it is a commonly held belief that the rich countries are try to increase it's economic wealth have become not satisfing to citixens anymore.
There is also an argument that raising the country economic has more advantages than disadvantages.
In my opinion, I consider that the countries must always have plans to increase their income whether they were rich or not.
Another point to consider, growing the country economic may help in future or to be saved to emergency situations.
Moreover, expansion of economics income could not make the people satisfied but in other hand may be used in increase the luxury life.
In other word, it is also possible to say that icreasing the wealth almost has no disadvantages to the country neither the citizens."
"This bar graph depicts the world health organization of consuming fruit and vegetables in percentage of males and females in the United Kingdom by age group in 2006.
Overall, females are more focused in their health than men. The consumption of fruits and vegetables in the United Kingdom is fluctuated because men has distinct percentages of consumption than females. Additionally, females has high number of percentage of consumption than males.
With regarding to males, their percentages of the consumption of fruits and vegetables is fluctuated. Firstly, it was 15 percent of consumption at ages 19-24 and after that it is rising up as their ages rises. Nevertheless, at ages 55-64 it increased with a great percentage. Unfortunately, they dropped down from 33 to 25 percent at ages 55-75.
Females consumption of fruits and vegetables is higher than the men consumption. They started with 16 percent at ages 19-24, then they continued rising up with a constant percentage, but at ages 55-64 females increased to 34 percent. Meanwhile, ages 64-74 the consumption of fruits and vegetables began to decrease from 34 to approximately 30 percent. Moreover, they dropped from 30 percent to 25 percent same as the males consumption of fruits and vegetables at ages 75."
"There are various numbers of countries that are rich from an economic weath such as petroleum, gas, and minerals. In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve."
"It is often recommended by world health organization individuals should take atleast five type of fruit and vegitables daily.To illustrate this, the bar chart indicates the males and females percentagewise in age group for the year of 22006 in United Kingdom
Overall, It was observed that the 55-64 age group took most significant rate of fruit and vegetables. Neverthelsee, the fimale dominate the process.
It is the fact that, Females were the most fruit and vegitable takers.The rate of taking these kind of food incresed as age increases toup to 55-56 age group where the rate started to fall uniformily.
In the other hand, the rate of taking fruit and vegetables for males taken the same trend as females,though the changes from one group of age to the proceeding one was not significant.However a
at the age of 75, it was observed that ,both Male and Females took the same rate of fruit and vegitalbes that was about 25%"
"Economist is often suggest that when the country is fully economically developed , any excessive economy does not make its people to be more satisfied.However some experts discuss this point of view differently.In my suggesttion, i strongly disagree to this point of view.In this essay i will point out the reason why the developed country have satisfied citizens regardless of additional in economic wealth.
First of all, the public social services will be improved.This is due tho the reason that the government is not limited to its economic resources.For example when the government want to construct new road of any distance kilometers,it will construct within a given period of time
Another reason is based on how people are willing to pay taxes. In any developed country, people are likely to pay taxes willingly.Forexample when a company generate its revenue for more than 100%, its capable to pay the taxes and pay its employee high salary and sweet bonus.This leads to satification of citizens.
Addition to that, is ability for the high and middle economy class citizens to provide support or donations to poor or low level economy class citizens.This is due to the fact that rich people are often likely to provide to bread to the poor one.
In conclution, its obvious the fact that addition economy in the developed country is not the only factor to make its people satisfiable.There are number of factor including political stability, good government leadership but few to mention.However in my opinion i believe additional economy in economically giant country dramatically contribute to satification of majority of citizens."
"This chart illustrates the proportion of British male and female in different age group buying fruit and vegetables as recommended by the world health organization per day in the year 2006.
In general, 55-64 years old British residents consume the most fruit and vegetables, while female spend more money on fruit and vegetables.
To be specific, it can be identified that elderly people would like to consume more healthy food than young people, of these, residents aged 55-64 years bought the most amount the whold age group, with approximately 32% and 35% of men and women respectively. It is worth to mention that among the elderly age group, 75 years old group is the only age group that different gender consume the same percentage fruit and vegetables in this chart.
As for the young and middle and people, people aged between 19 and 24 consume the least healthy food compare with the rest of the age group in this bar chart, which is around 15%, while female consume slightly higher than man. By contrast, in the age group of 45-54, the percentage between male (around 23%) and female (around 27%) has the gap compare with the rest of the age group."
"Some people argue that if a country is rich enough, then the residents will not be satisfied by the increase in economic wealth. From my point of view, I completely disagree this opinion.
Firstly, there still has a gap between rich and poor people in the reach country. As the economic situation of a country is getting better and better, it is true that most of the people would like to believe that all the residents will live a happy ever life. But still, there must be some people struggle to manage their life. Take China as an example, the GDP of China saw a dramatic increase in the recent years, people in the mega cities or the first level cities like Beijing and Shanghai do not worry about their food anymore, and can enjoy their high quality life. However, there still has some poor citizens who live in the small city and trying their best to feed their children. These poor people may not earn enough salaries or lost their job, thus, any addiction increase in economic wealth may be an opportunity for them, which can makes them feel satisfied enough.
Secondly, the growth in economic will make residents richer than before. People are living in the material world, no one will refuse the economic wealth to make their life better. A rich country means most of the residents in this country is middle or above middle class, an increase in the economic wealth means they can get a better house, send their children to a better school, spend more time on leisure activity instead of working, for all these benefits that the economic growth bring to them, they would fell satisfied.
In conclusion, I believe that in the rich country, people are still satisfied the increase in economic wealth, as this can reduce the gap between rich and poor people, and allow citizens to enjoy their life better."
"It is recommended by the world health organization to eat at least five portions of vegetables and fruit each day. The graph illustrates the percentage of people from UK who consuming these portions in 2006.
Overall, it can be seen that data are reported by age group and gender. Female from 55 to 64 years old achieved the highest percentage on the chart. However, the lowest one is represented by young males from 19 to 24 years old, at 15%.
One of the main features is that male adults from 35 to 44 and between 45 to 54 years old accounting both for slightly more than 20%. Another main features is that the percentages of female increased to 15% to 35% until they are 64, then decrease to 25%. The consuming by males are quite similar and it is clear if we look to the fist four groups of bars which, in order accounting for 15%, 20% and almost 25% for the last two."
"The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.
It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.
Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.
To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them."

"This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.
According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages.

"There is no doubt that these days the rich country is important to developed their cities and improve their young people skills. The question is how when a country is already rich if increase any additional in economy its citizens any more satisfied, What is happen in the future? In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of problems, the most population in rich country, They not feel to under them which income in their country. The main reason given to support this claim is that they usually comfortable life and request additional, subsequently they not engurage to support the limit people income. To illustrate, In Japan the population most of them is selfish, They not donate or help the limit people income. In other words the rich countries when additional increase in economy is become negative things.
However, The some rich countries is support young people and donate to poor countries. Firstly, UK is support its population in terms of sports. In other words they built several sport facilities to support official clubs and public people. For instance, Football fields in public places, which the more people saves their health. Secondly, In France it has some factories for make the cars, And bring students from the cars college to the factories because take experience before graduation. Also, some of the young people they has unique hobby, subsequently rich country it can spent money to support talent young.
In conclusion, although the rich countries when received any additional to increase economy dose not make any more satisfied. Therefore, I believe that increase in economy in rich countries it is necessary to developed the country and their different population."
"The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.
Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.
To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.
To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers."
"An increasing number of individuals are taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery in order to achieve a better appearance. I strongly believe that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery are the reasons for the above. Likewise, I think that it is a negative development for our society.
To begin with, it is very well known that mass media advertising and lower costs of surgery affect the behaviour of the citizens. Mass media advertising is promoting an uncommon archetype among the population. Plenty of men and women feel that they do not have sex appeal due to the fact that their bodies are different to those shown on television. Moreover, cosmetic surgery costs are more affordable nowadays than before. Hence, several women receive cosmetic surgery as a birthday gift.
Additionally, I strongly believe that taking the decision to have cosmetic surgery reflects a negative development in our communities for the reason that it reveals that plenty of people have mental health issues. For instance, low self-esteem has been increasing among the young population during the last years. Besides that, cosmetic surgery centres the attention on beauty instead of other more important values, such as honesty, creativity and charity. For example, there are fewer Non-Governmental Organizations such as Green Peace at the present moment than in the past.
To conclude, harmful mass media advertising and lower costs of cosmetic surgery translate into a negative development in our communities due to mental health issues and citizens spending money on nonsense. I would strongly recommend that authorities create laws to regulate mass media advertising."
"Information is presented by two graphs which depict the monthly average daily temperature and the monthly average number of raining days in two particular cities in Australia.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that the average daily temperature in Brisbane is higher than that in Canberra over the survey period. In addition, while Brisbane experiences a wide variety of changes in the average number of raining days, the figure for days with rainfall in Canberra remains unchanged approximately.
Turning to the first main feature in the line graph, in February Brisbane reached the highest average maximum temperature of an exact 30 degrees Celsius, whereas the average maximum temperature in Canberra is about 3 degrees Celsius less than that in Brisbane. The average maximum temperature in Brisbane then falls noticeably and levels off at around just above 20 degrees Celsius until July. On the other hand, the figure for the average maximum temperature in Canberra decreases substantially to a little more than 10 degrees Celsius which is the lowest point. By December, the average maximum temperature in both Brisbane and Canberra rises considerably to just below 30 and about 27 degrees Celsius respectively.
With respect to the average minimum temperature, there is a temperature fluctuation in both cities throughout the year. In January, the average minimum temperature in Brisbane and Canberra is just above 20 and about 13 degrees Celsius respectively. The figure for the average minimum temperature then drops remarkably to the lowest point of 10 degrees Celsius in Brisbane and nearly zero in Canberra in July. By the end of the period, the temperature bounce back to almost the same level as in January.
Turning to the key feature in the line graph, Brisbane reached the highest average number of raining days of a precise 14 days in February which maintains the same level until March. Then the average number of raining days in Brisbane drops substantially and levels off at approximately 7 days which is the lowest number, before rising to 12 days in December. On the contrary, Canberra experiences a period of stability at roughly 7 days. Nevertheless, the average number of raining days in Canberra jump suddenly to an exact 10 days between June and August, exceeding the figure for Canberra before dropping to about 7 days by the end of the period."
"There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.
It is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
Contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections."
"The graph and chart below provide us with some data on the average temeperatures measured in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month for Brisbane and Canberra.
Overall, we can see that on the whole the average temperatures and amount of rainy days in Brisbane is higher then in Canberra. In addition, while winter is the hotest season in both Brisbane and Canberra, the highest numbers of rainy days are appears to be in completely different months in these two cities.
Based on the chart and graph, the average temperature in Brisbane reachs its peak in winter when maximum and minimum average temperatures are nearly 21 and 30 degrees Celsius respectively. Simultaneously, the average quantity of days with rainfall in Brisbane is also the highest ( approximately 14 per month) within the same period. On the contrary, the most rainy time in Canberra is summer, when the average amount of days with rainfall reachs its peak of nearly 10 days per each month; meanwhile, the lowest average temperatures measured in Canberra are also in summer with almost 0 degrees Celsius minimum and roughly 13 degrees Celsius maximum."
"People have always desired to improve their external features. However, while the time went by, methods of changing appearance for the better have significantly changed. Today, more and more people decide to improve the way they look via cosmetic surgery. In the following essay I'm going to speculate on the topic and explain some possible reasons of this trend.
Obviously, there are plenty of reasons of this tendancy. To start with, operation is an easy way of improving your appearance. People are attracted by this method because they don't need to go to the gym or control their diet anymore. The only thing they need is to call a special doctor and pay money. In addition, it's obvious that every trend is caused by the changes of standarts in society. Nowadays, the number of people who are sure that unnatural beauty is attractive is growing every day. Affected by the opinion of their friends or family members more and more women decide to use surgery in order to change face or other part of the body.
Personally, I strongly believe that this bandwagon both worsens the way people look harms health as well. I'm convinced that nothing can surpass natural beauty; meanwhile, every medical operation goes against people's organism and spills what was created by the universe. For example, some famous artists who have used cosmetic surgery in order to stay young are now looking like dolls. What's more, sometimes chemicals which are used during such operations can cause awful consequences for not only people's appearance, but for their health as well. I can still remember a story of one boy who wanted to swell his muscles in a shorter way by using some medecine but, as a result, he appeard in a hospital with serious blood illness due to inappropriate choice and careless usage.
Taking everything into account, it's my firm conviction that even though cosmetic surgery seems to be a proper way of improving appearance, it is very overrated. On the contrary, such operations do not only worsen the way people look , but can be extremely dangeraus for their organism as well, while natural beauty is here to stay forever."
"The graph and chart illustrates the highest and lowest temperature in degrees Celcius occur each day and the mean number of rainfall everyday for two Australian cities.
Overall, Brisbane experienced its hottest temperature and two weeks of rain during February. On the other hand, Canberra reached its lowest temperature and more than a week of rain in the months of June and July.
Brisbane reached a 30 degrees Celsius temperature in February which is about 3 degrees higher than Canberra. Canberra experienced its coldest temperature about 1 degree Celsius, in June and July in the same month Canberra received 10 days of rainfall.
Although both cities encountered almost the same temperature in the months of March and December, which is in contrast to the number of rainfalls received. There is about a 6 day difference in March and around 7 days in June.
That would be the end of the report about the temperature and average rainfall experienced in two Australian cities."
"A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.
In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.
The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.
There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.
To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body."
"Information regarding the litres of milk producted by four different countries in 1990, 2000, and 2010 are provided in the table.
Overall, it can be seen that the amount of production was highert at the end of the period in the four countries compared to 1990. Netherlands produced the highest amount during the 3 years compared to its counterpart, whereas Guatemala produced the lowest.
Looking to the table in more detail, the litres of milk produced by Netherlands were superior the tree years compared to the other countries. For example, in 2000 the country made 11,155,000 litres, and in 2010 11,466,000. Australia followed the trend for the first 10 years. However, its production decreased slightly in 2010, for almost 2,060,000 fewer litres than in 2000.
Additionally, Tanzinian and Guatemalan production, which also grew over the years, showed lowest amount of milk compared with the highest, Netherlands and Australia. For instance, Tanzania went up from 87,000 in 1990 to 155,000 litres in 2010, almost the double. Guatemala, similarly, rose the numbers of litres from almost four times as much as in 1990, reaching a total of 84,000 litres in 2010."
"Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.
One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.
On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.
In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.
In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship."
"The table is presenting that amount in litres of milk production at these four diffrent coutries in specific three each year during 20 years term.
Netherlands and Australia are producing significantly big number of litres milk, compare with those other countries. In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.
Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.
Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000"
"What children like to do in free time ? All children have diffrent ideas and preferences. So that many parenets think what should they provide and organize for their kids or not.
Children have free mind. Sometimes that make out of control their behaviours. In this modern world, we have so manyv tools to connect to out side of their world, for example internet, social network. If parents are not organised to kids's freet time, children have so many chance to take those tools. Not all internet stuffs are bad, but also there are lots of appropriate contents for kids around. Kids should be protected and orverviewed by parents or caregivers whatever they are doing. Moreover, if they are not controlled their free time by parents, kids never have limit of spending time for something they are into it. Time management is important for kids, free time shouldn't be until late night.
On the other hand, what will be happned if parents don't organised their free time.
Kids are using their imagination or ideas in their free time to play. There is no organising stuff from parents, so that they might try to find what they need and want to do. Therefore, they develop their indepndence and social skills.
In my opinion, I think kids should be organised their free time by parents. Compared with both side of effect, I personally choose kids's safety rather than developping independence. Independence and social skills can develop in other situation also. Howevere, kids""s safety cant choose"
"The provided data compares the amount of milk manufactured in 1990, 2000, and 2010 by country. Overall, throughout the years, the Netherlands topped the chart, followed by Australia, Tanzania, and Guatemala. While the amount of milk produced in Tanzania and Guatemala eased up, Australia produced fewer milk as the time went by.
Among the countires, the dairy produced in the Netherlands and Australia were much higher than the other two. The number of litres produced in the Netherlands slightly fluctuated but remained the highest, which were all in the eleven millions. On the other hand, the Australian also started in their eleven millions in 1990 and 2000 but drastically plunged to nine millions in 2010.
Meanwhile, Tanzania began significantly lower at 87,000 litres in 1990, leaped up to 142,000 in 2000 and continued to edged up to 155,000 litres in 2010. At the bottom of the table, stood Guatemala which produced only 26,000 litres in 1990. Although the number doubled up to 55,000 in 2000 and constantly rocketed up to 84,000 litres in 2010, the Guatemala finished at only half the amount of Tanzania."
"Apart from education, leisure is an essential part that helps children to discover their interests and develop both physical and mental abilities. While many agree that parents are responsible for managing their children's free time, the others argue that the kids themselves should be entitled to make their own decisions. As a grown up, I personally believe that the kids should be allowed to select activities based on their preferences within the scope provided by the parents, as per the following reasons.
To begin with, no one likes to be forced. After long days of either tiresome work or study, everyone wants to enjoy their time afterwards. This also applies to the students, which in many cultures, are put into after school classes to spend more time tutoring in order to catch up with the academic standards. Although some can endure this intense lifestyle, most of the time, these schedules usually cause the kids to be overworked and stressed. Therefore, it is important to spare some times for the children to manage their own activities. Nevertheless, unlike adults who are financially independent, the kids can be subjected to many limitations.
Despite being able to participate in many activities, the underages must be legally supervised by several reasons, one of them being decision-making abilitiy. Parents can play a very important part in disapproving activities that are inappropriate for the kids. For example, if not accompanied or consulted, children can end up meeting with strangers or playing dangerous extreme sports. Furthermore, most of the time, the underages usually rely on their parents' earnings, which lead back to them approving the recreational budgets.
All in all, it is necessary to allow the kids to have autonomy over their free time as it allows them to develop sense of responsibility along with discovering their interests. However, these decisions must be reviewed and approved by the parents to ensure the budget added and security of the children themselves."
"On this chart we can see a few differences between 3 different country: in Netherlands the amount of milk products in 20 years is more ore less the same.
In Australia has dropped a little bit especially around the last 10 years between 2000 and 2010.
In Tazmania we can see the biggest drop on this chart.
And in Guatemala the amount of litres has increased a lot in the last 20 years.
This number show us that Netherland always kept the same amount of liters products, Australia too except for the last 10 years but the number did not devolved much.
For sure Guatemala got the best upgrade, while Tazmania the worste: is unbelievable the Difference between 1990 and 2010.
I Hope Tazmania will do something to fill this lack, as the price of milk has increased a lot as the amount product cannot satisfy all the population.
Hopefully Guatemala will keep going on this way"
"I agree with both: many activities must be organise by parents as kids have not much knowledge about what to do sometimes.
Freedom for childrens is going to the park and play football with other friends, or going to the cinema, but they cannot do everything without parents help.
Cristiano Ronaldo wants to force his kid to be the number one on football, I don't think this is the right way, because he's put so much pressure on him, he should let him choose his life.
Also depends where you live, I think in Australia is easier let your children do some experience by himself, here is a very safety country I don't think parents must be too concerned about their children's also because if you stay too close to them, they will grown spoiled, weak and without self esteem.
Children's should start to make mistake since the beginning and understand what life is...
Parents always protect kids and they don't allow them see bad things but my opinion is: make them ready for the life, even if one thing is uncomfortable or unpleasant let them see, probably the shock will be very high but slowly it will get lighter, strong moments make strong people, weak moments make weak people...
At the end of this topic I can confirm that the best experiences of my life has been made by myself, without parents, without help, just with my friends and my curiosity, parents must follow us until the end of our childhood but after that, we have to start work with our feet."
"The bar chart illustrates the expenditure on three categories, namely, food and drink, restaurants and hotels, and entertainment among five age groups of British individuals in 2004.
Overall, it can clearly be seen that the age older groups pay more for food and drink, and entertainment with the exception of the age group over 76. In contrast, people under 60 pay more for restaurants and hotels than those who above 61.
Looking at the information in more detail, we can see that the age group over 76 spent the highest money on food and drink (23%), which was twice as much as the spent (12%) of the age group 31-45 and almost four times of the spent(6%) of the group under 30. Surprisingly, people of the age group 61-75 pay only 2% for restaurants and hotels and spent nearly 12 times of former money(23%) to entertain themselves, which was twice the expenditure of the age groups 46-60 and over 76, respectively."
"Young people in some countries are encouraged to take one gap year to work or travel abroad between their high school and university studies. This essay will discuss both of the benefits and drawbacks of the experiences of one year adventure in foreign countries for young people.
To start with, there are several advantages to this adventure abroad. Firstly, young people can meet people from different cultures, beliefs, and ages, and broaden their thoughts and experiences of the world. For instance, they may have cultural shock and reflect their own views and values about life and the world. In this way, they may become more open-minded and tolerant of different people and cultures. Secondly, they can make friends with people in other countries and broaden their social networks. This can become long-term friendships and they can gain a global perspective of the world. This is not only beneficial for themselves, but it can also benefit their societies and countries in long run as well.
However, there are also potential drawbacks to this journey. First and foremost, they can encounter some dangerous situations, such as being scammed, robbed, and even physically harmed. Numerous reports in the media about unfortunate cases that young people in foreign countries being kidnapped, forced to consume or sell drugs, and even being killed. It could be dangerous for them if they meet local gangster bands and have no one to rescue them. Therefore, it is essential that young people take precautions to keep their safety while abroad.
To sum up, although there are potential risks in the one-year journey, the advantages of broadening their horizons of thoughts, becoming open-minded, and experiences of forming new friendships with people in other countries could outweigh the disadvantages if the young people take measures for their safety while abroad."
"The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.
Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.
Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.
In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age."
"In other nations, after graduation in high school, youth are encouraged to go overseas for travel or to find a job for a period of one year prior to enrollment in universities for continuing studies. Some people believed that these have an effect on young people. The advantages on young people when working or traveling before entering college are saving money and making funds which can be used for matriculation, and they can have enough time for mental break which foster mental health that will help them more prepared individual as student. While the disadvantages are waste of money when traveling and delayed finishing studies when working.
Moreover, when deciding to take an educational break for travel or work between finishing high school and entering in college has advantages. First would be making funds for enrollment fees and saving money for allowance. Young people can have the opportunity to support themselves in their studies instead of asking financial support from parents. By this way, they become more independent because they can provide their daily necessities. Second would be achieving healthy mental health through traveling abroad. For some students, high school is stressful just like college especially when they are too serious in studying. Going abroad for a vacation might help to destress the students at the same time giving self a time for relaxation which is essential to the mind and body.
However, this decision also brings disadvantages to young people like wasting of money or savings from parents when traveling abroad. Instead of saving this money for college, it is used for booking a trip, hotel accommodation, and other recreational activities. Another would be waste of time, because instead of finishing studies on time in a university, students might be delayed in their graduation because of a year spent in vacation. As a consequence, timeline in studying and getting a degree is longer than usual."
"The bar chart illustrates the spending on some demands between different citizens age groups in the UK in 2004.
Overall, it is clear that the need for food and drink belonged to the oldest age group. The trend of expenses for restaurant and hotel had a slight decrease before falling significantly and going up, while that of entertainment had tend to be completely opposite.
In the first category, the percentage of expenditure on restaurant and hotel of the age group under 30 was the highest at nearly 15%. In the next age groups, there was a slight decrease at around 12%, respectively group 31 to 45 and group 46 to 60. The figure for this category reached a bottom at 2% of the age group 61 to 75 before climbing sharply to 7% in the age group 76 plus.
In the next category, this trend of the budget for entertainment was the opposite totally with demand for restaurant and hotel and reached a peak at nearly 23% in the age group 61 to 75. The last category was food and drink which started at nearly 6% in the age group under 30 and went up gradually to around 23% in the oldest age group 76 plus in 2004."
"The gap year is an issue that has sparked debate. It is widely accepted that young people should travel or work for a year between completing high school and beginning university studies. From a personal perspective, the benefits are more significant than the drawbacks for young people who decide to have a gap year.
On the one hand, most students who just completed high school education have stressful periods and lots of plans that want to do. Young people could feel disoriented which means they need time for finding what they want. There are a lot of youths who put themselves under pressure thus, they get more and more stress in their study and work and can get some mental illness. In order to have a gap year, they will have enough time to relax and establish a plan for their future. Nowadays, more and more students decide to choose a year to do anything that they hope to perform. Besides, their decision will help them understand themselves, and have opportunities to experience jobs that have not been done before such as volunteer work and long-day traveling.
On the second hand, there are some negative points of a gap year for the youths. The young people who decide to have a free year will face late completing university studies which may lead to having fewer opportunities than their peers deciding to start university immediately. On some occasions, it is difficult for young people who do not have any experience to find internship jobs. Thus, they may waste lots of time without any achievement.
To sum up, the gap year will bring more experiences for young people. It is my belief that the advantages outweigh the others."
"Information is presented by a bar chart which compares the total spending on three particular purposes, classified by 5 different age groups of citizens in the UK in 2004. Overall, it can be clearly seen that while the popularity of food and drink, and entertainment increased as people got older, the demand for restaurant and hotel changed in the opposite direction.
Turning to the first main feature, people who were under 30 years old were the majority group that spent on restaurant and hotel, amounting to just below 15% of the total spending, whereas older people in the 61-75 age group spent on this category the least, accounting for approximately 2%. In addition, there was a little more than 10% of the total spending which was contributed by people who were in the 31-45 and 46-60 age group equally.
Turning to another main feature, in terms of food and drink, there was only just above 5% of the total spending, paid by people who were under 30 years old. Nevertheless, the expenditure ratio rose as the number of age was higher. The largest proportion of spending on food and beverage was about 23%, contributed by people who were 76 years old or over.
Focusing further on the last category (entertainment), the proportion of the total disbursement grew when people were older. There was just a little more than 5%, spent by people who were below 30 years old on entertainment. However, the ratio of the spending on entertainment rose to around 23% for people who were in 61-75 age group, which is the highest percentage and also the same number as that for people in more-than-76 age group who spent on food and beverage."
"Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.
It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working."
"Information is presented in two tables which compare the number of students exchanging between universities in Europe and Australia in two different years (2007 and 2009).
Overall, it can be clearly seen that the popularity of exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia is more than that of exchange students from Australia universities to universities in Europe in both years.
Turning to the first main feature in the first table, a modest 27 students in Germany joined the exchange program to universities in Australia in 2007. The figure for exchange students from Germany to Australia then soared to a precise 62 in 2009. On the other hand, there was a decrease of an exact 5 people in the figure for exchange students from universities in the United Kingdom to universities in Australia, from 31 people in 2007 to 26 people in 2009. Nevertheless, the number of exchange students in Netherland remained unchanged at an exact 36 in both 2007 and 2009.
Focusing further on another main feature in the second table, each of 32 students from universities in the United Kingdom and Netherland exchanged to universities in Australia in 2007. In 2009 the number of exchange students from the United Kingdom and Netherland fell to a modest 23 and 18 respectively. On the contrary, there was a substantial rise of a massive 21 people in the figure for exchange students from France to Australia, from an exact 37 people in 2007 to a precise 58 people in 2009.
The last key point to note is the total number of exchange students in both tables. There were 189 and 226 exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia universities in 2007 and 2009 respectively. On the other hand, the figure for students exchanging from Australia to Europe was remained stable at a modest 152 in both years."
"There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.
It is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.
In spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English."
"The first table shows us the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009. Overall, the statistic reported that students from Europe countries came to Australia stayed fluctuated depended on each nation. The amount of students who moved to Australia from Europe in 2009 is risened from the amount of 189 belonged to the year 2007. The second table shows us exchange students from universities in Australia to Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, the statistic reported that students from Australia came to Europe countries stayed fluctuated depended on each nation. The amount of students who moved to Europe from Australia in 2009 is stable to the amount of students leaving abroad from Australia in the year 2007. Therefore, the analysis shows a comparison in which students in Europe prefer moving foward to Australia rather than staying in their area and students in Australia prefer to keep going in their nation than trvel abroad. Some demonstrations can be illustrated. Majorly, countries export their students from Europe frequently owns a higher amount of students who travel abroad to Australia in both years, whereas, the estimated amount of students in Australia who travel to foreigner's universities is less than from Europe in the both 2007 and 2009. Furthermore, the total amount of students from Europe who came to Australia showed that it is rising year by year, especially from 2007 to 2009, scrutinizing the amount of students who traveled from Australia to Europe, it is still staying sustain for 2 years, proved that students in Europe prefer moving foward to Australia rather than staying in their area and students in Australia prefer to keep going in their nation than trvel abroad. To summarize, Australia is assumed as better working and learning conditions due to the illustrations from two of the tables"
"Nowadays, English is commonly demonstrating its' efficiency for the understanding of knowledge in variety of fields, such as economy, biology, psychology, politic and an abundance in opportunity for jobs and employments. Human with their awareness, cognition reveal that the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. I agree with this statement. Firstly, English as a primary invention for interactions and social communicating have been playing an important role for the innovative development of the society, to identify, some countries in the world are colonized by the United Kingdom became more revolutional and now developed, as a consequence, the culture of learning the international language which is English is spreaded through nations and generations of migrating from countries to countries, this create a better understanding and initialize investments between the developed and the undeveloped ones through an international language. Moreover, English is a both logical and basic international language, throughout years of developing, English with its' improvements in meanings and pronunciations, is recognized as a familiarity to everyone, it is gradually becoming easier and not too complicated for people to learn, as a result, English can expedite the problem of language barrier and easily becomes a global language. Furthermore, English as an international language with its' ease and uncomplicated structures can get people the opportunity to get themselves their employment, since English is already known as a popularity in ways of interacting with languages, verbal communication, if English can be spreaded, it can cure the problems of unemployment and a lack of work force. In summarize, English is an amazing language, with its' growth, we can hope for a better perspective, and for a better communication."
"These two tables depict the students movment between Europe and Australia universities in 2007 and 2009. It's clear from the tables that the students that moved from Europe to Australia is more.
According to what is shown , students that moved from Europe to Australia had the largest number . Students moved especially from France had the largest propotion with 121 students . The total increased from 189 student to 226 during two years.
On other hand , the transfer movement in the oppisite way had a less number of students. The total of students moved from Australia to Europe was 304 during two years . France had the largest number of students that moved in between 2009 and 2007 . While Netherland recorded the lowest number in 2009 by 18 student.
To sum up , the transfer movment to Europe was lower than the movment to Australia with a difference to nearly 100 student."
"There is no doubt that these days more people is learning and talking by English language. The question is, is this viral of English has a negative view or not? In this essay I will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before . In other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking English or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .To illustrate, If you are travelling to Italy you don't have to learn Italian language your English will be enough. Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.
Moreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.
In conclusion, although this spread of English may diminish other languages, but still having English language is important. That's why I believe that using English is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues."
"The two diagrams compare the number of exchange students from European universities to Australia, and from universities in Australia to Europe spanning from 2007 through 2009.
Overall, the total amout of students from Australia universities to universities in Europe during two years of span is much smaller than the total amout of students from universities in Europe to Australia. Over the period of two years, more exchange students from European universities study in Australia.
According to the first table, it is apparent that total number of students study from universities in Europe to Australia increase between 2007 to 2009, where it accounts from 189 to 226 people. Among all the Europeans countries, the number of exchange students from Germany to Australia rises significantly over the span of two years. The number of students there climbs to almost triple of the original number of students in 2007. However, the second table clearly shows the total number of exchange students from Australia universities to universities in Europe from 2007 to 2009 remain the same, reaching 152 numbers of students.
We can see from the two tables below, both the amounts of students from universities in Europe to Australia in 2007 and 2009 are bigger than the amounts of students from Australia universities to European universities, in which the number of students from universities in Europe to Australia in 2009 is the biggest of all, having 226 students study in Australia, whereas in 2009, only 152 students goes from Australia universities to universities in Europe."
"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.
In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws."
"The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.
To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.
When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.

"Since the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.
In contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.
Finally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.
In conclusion, English will continuously spread worldwide."

"The areas most likely to consume insect products are countries in central and south america, along with certain parts of Asia. Specifically, these are the countries that are more willing, than unwilling, to eat insect products: Mexico (71%), Peru (58%), Thailand (56%). It may perhaps be that these countries already consume insects as part of their diet. If this is case, it may explain their greater willingness to consume insect products. Some of the countries least likely to consume insect products include Japan (21%), Russia (32%), and Spain (33%).
In the United States, specifically, 35% of responders are willing to consume insects. Overall, the cost of purchasing a non-insect, such as buffalo and beef, is lower than purchasing insects. The highest cost is of beef at 3.03 USD/kg, as compared to the lowest costing insect - giant water bug at 2.6 USD/kg. Due to the dieteray norms in the United States, people are more likely to be acqainted with eating and preparing beef, as opposed to the giant water bug - and it may provide nutritional benefits that are difficult to be found in relatively smaller animals such as insects. Overall, the range for purchasing insects as food products is from 10.65 USD/kg to 2.6 USD/kg, while non-insect products are overall more inexpensive, ranging from 0.78 USD/kg to 3.03 USD/kg."
"Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.
I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.
I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again."
"In view of the food shortage around the world, the idea of having insect-based protein is raising. According to recent research on the willingness to consume insects as food, it shows that the countries likely to accept insect products are Mexico with 71% of people willing to eat insects, followed by Peru and Thailand, which have 58% and 56 % of the population accept the idea. While Russia, Australia and USA against having bug-based foods the most that only 32%, 34% and 35% of the general public are willing to taste insects.
However, it is doubtful that utilizing insect-based food is a solution to the food crisis. The research also stated the market price of insects. The general price of insects is at least double compared to plant-based food like rice. The price of some kinds of insects like weaver ants and bamboo caterpillars is even triple the price compared to beef. Having bugs as a new protein source is still a question mark at this moment."
"Having insects as food is not a new idea. In some Southeast Asia countries such as Thailand and Columbia, bugs like spiders and grasshoppers are common protein sources for the general public. To solve the food shortage in the growing population around the world, there is a voice to consume insect-based products instead of traditional meats. Meat industries have a negative reputation for being eco-unfriendly. Also, not all the family can afford to have meat. So is insect-based food a solution to the population booming era?
First of all, let us look into what insects take part in the ecosystem, Insects are at the bottom of the food chain. It means that many animals consume bugs as their main diet. One of the concerns of humans eating insects for food is whether the collection of insects will affect the environment. Over-collecting insects may endanger some species which rely on insects to survive. Farming insects may be an idea to grow insects for food but the impact on the farming environment is still under observation.
Food safety is another concern of eating insects. There are a few thousand kinds of insects, some of which are known as poison. Although most of the edible insects do not contain poison, identifying which kinds of insects are safe to eat will be an issue.
Nevertheless, eating insects can be an option. There are some countries that are mature in having insects. Whichever sources of the insects are safe and eco-friendly, insects can be a subsidy of proteins when lacking meat sources. However, there is still a long road for insects to become the main source of food in this state."
"The provided diagrams illustrate the percentage of willingness to consume insect based products by countries and compared the substituted products price to the current food ingredients. While most countries are against insects consumption, Peru is, by far, more willing to shift to eat bugs. Overall, insects price per kilogram are much higher than majority of other ingredients available.
Looking into details, Mexico is the only country that has high rate of willingness on bugs consumption at 71%, followed by Peru and Thailand where the rates are slightly higher than half of their population. Meanwhile, although only upto 89% of Japaneses refuse to eat insects, India, Russia and the US are not as strongly opposed as their willingness rates are still in thrities as well as China and Brazil whose population over forties can try to consume bugs as substitutes.
On the other hand, compared to current available food sources, the most expensive bugs, which is weaver ant, costs 10.65 USD per kilograms which is more than triple the price of beef. The female giant water bug which is costed the least, at 2.6 USD per kilogram, is still only 40 cents cheaper than beef, the most expensive current protein source."
"Among all of global issues, food shortage can clearly be seen as one of the most concerning as the ultimate result of this issue is hunger and death which is relatable to all. One of the solution being brought into spotlight is consuming insects. While some people believe that this can be a proper path to end the world's hunger, others argue that it will further lead new problems.
To begin with, there are various aspects of advantages in using bugs as protein substitutes. Bugs are not only available in all continents but the majority of them have short life cycles. If farms shift to grow insects rather than the currently available lifestock, less costs and investments will be needed as they only need weeks to mature while other lifestocks require months or even years. Then, what prevent the humanity to covert to insectivore?
As well as tremendous benefits, the idea of consuming athropods can raise numbers of concerns. Introduction of new insect species and increase of their populations can extremely affect native ecosystem. To elaborate this, alien species introduced from one area to another can be dangerously invasive and can ultimately result in extinction of native species. One example is gold fish which were released into lakes can multiply their populations in short period and over the years, they doubled in size and eradicated their counterparts in original food chain. Therefore, arthropods which are much smaller and aglier can effortlessly escape farms and survive in extreme environment will cause disasters to the nature and crops in the farming areas.
All in all, consumption of insects can be humanity's new opportunity to survive as it requires less resources and provides abundant produces. Nevertheless, this change in food source require more researches to ensure sanitary and nutritions as well as time for the consumers' adaption to the new concept."
"The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.
On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.
It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs."
"Food is one of the the most essential need for human beings. As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand. A huge percentage of the world population are experiencing starvation and nutrients deficiency. In order to solve world hunger issues, providing edible insects as an option for food could be a feasible solution.
Chicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature. Although small, they are a significant part of the ecosystem. Making insects a food option would decrease their numbers which could create crucial changes that we are not prepared for.
However, using edible insects as a food option would help to provide a bigger and wider range of choices for the world population. As the population grows, it is only logical to also increase the food supply. Furthermore, there are countries across the globe with high willingness to try insects as a food option. If we utilize this data accordingly, we may be able to provide an additional option to countries that would like to try them.
In conclusion, people in many parts of the world are not ready to consume edible insects. In my opinion, raising awareness on reducing meat consumerism may be easier and a more feasible solution to the problem. It is evident that our societies need more research on insects as food product."
"In the chart below, we can see some information about eating insect products and the current price for the specific meal available in the marketplace and that pictures also describe few meals with number to describe the using of those meals. For example,Buffallo is 2.38,Beef-3.03,pork-1.91,chicken-1.08,glutinous rice-0.82,rice-0.78,Giant water bug-3.3 and so on.In those showing items, weaver ant(wild) is the highest using meal with the rating ff 10.65 and the less usable item is Rice with 0.78 of total use. But, the best describe with the percentage where Mexico has the most percentage of insect-based products in global willingness with 71 percent and on the other hand Peru stands in second position with 58 percent. Also, Thailand is in number 3rd position with 56 percent in global willingness."
"Nowadays, populations are growing all over the world, and increasing the source of food is becoming more important and also being challenging nowadays. One of the most important matters nowadays is eating insects and unhealthy sources of natural food. Some people in some areas are getting benefits from eating insects as a meal where insects are the worst scenario in nature.
however, there is some cultivating support that comes from insects which is a positive impact on the land or cultivating areas. Such as, it helps plants to grow fast and healthier. Many people use insects in their cultivating land as organic manure. it reduces dying trees and plants and provides enough energy and nutrition to plants to grow faster, healthier, and keep fresh. All over the world, people in so many areas are most familiar with those insects. By using insects on their land, they are doing it with less cost and more efficiency and also they are not providing too much effort to get insects as it comes from nature so easily.
For some people, eating insects is so common and reliable but it gives a lot of bad experiences when it publishes negative reactions in the human body. some people suffer from eating insects a lot. sometimes it gives people nutrition and energy as they believe but sometimes it is just the worst scenario having or eating insects such as diarehuiya,colleriahuia, and common bacterial issues in the human body. Mostly it happens when people are not enough insured of using or knowing how to process insects and make them ready to eat."
"To my honest university:
I will write a report to describe the neuron.
A nruron is a whole systerm,it includes a cell body,many dendrites,five myelin sheathes ,a axon and a lot of terminal buttons.
How do the these parts work?
The cell boby is in the center of the cell boby.
Dendrites connect from another neuron and receive messages from other cells.
Five myelin sheathes cover the axon of some neurons and help speed neural impulses.
The axon passes messages away from the cell body to other neurons ,muscles,or glands.
Five myelin sheathes and the axon spend a electrical signal.
Terminal buttons connect from junctions wieh other cells.
I describe the neuron over！
Thank you!
Have a great day!"
"It is the time to talk with the elderly people society ,because the elderly people society is coming today . There are more and more elderly men and women in the world .In my home country ,there are 40% elderly people.The elderly people society will bring a lot of questions to us,but we must face with thes questions.
All of us konw that the elderly people can not work,and they must be looked after,but we love them,because they are our fathers and mothers ,they are working many many years,and some day we will become old people ,then we need to look after by new younger men .
We need many youngers that can join us.The elderly people can not do much things,for example take a bus,go to hosiptal and even walk.Maybe they need someone next to themselves all of the time.
I think that the elderly people do not need to be managed,they need to be loved,because they are the people,they are not the anomals or some things.people need love,not manage.The looking after is not managing.
Althought the elderly people do not need to be managed ,we need the some new tech-ways to look after them,for examples wo can use the computers, cell phones and other tools to help the elderly people.
Everyone must feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today,we must be brave.We must work hard and hard .
We are ready for the elderly people society,and I hope that all of the elderly people are happiness.Elderly is not the end,it is a begining."
"The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.
The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.
The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network."
"As the world has been experiencing rapidly aging population, the issue of providing proper care for the elderly is concerning the society. However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.
As the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or elders’ clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.
Another reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.
Last but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.
In conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management."
"The illustration below is represnting the parts of a neuron. A neuron cell consists of four three parts, these are the Cell body, Action potential, and the Terminal buttons.
Start with the Cell Body, otherwise known as the soma, it has shape of small ball in its center with tree-roots like lines surrounding it. These lines are called the Dendrites, and theu are responsible for the communication between the neurons. The Dendrites send and recive messages between neurons when physically contacting with each other.
The second part that forms the neuron, is called the Action potential. This section of the neuron consist of the Axon and the Myelin sheath. First of all, the Axon, which is formed as long line extending from the Dendrites, is considred the communication bridge between the cell body and other neurons, muscles, or glands. The second part og the Action potential, is the Myelin sheath cylinders, which are connected with each other as a chain. The Myelin sheath is responsible for covring the Axcon for protection and speeding up the neural impluses.
Lastly, the last part of the neuron is the Terminal buttons, this part recives the neural impluses from the Axcon and form junctions with other cells to send the message."
"In our modern society and the development and improvement of health care sector, the average expected life age has increased comparing to what it was like in the past. This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.
First of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.
Nevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.
To summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder."
"The diagram shows how neuron works and its components. Its possible identify that Dendrites is the conection component, responsabile for receive any mensage from other cells. After that it has the compenent named Axon. Axon passes messages throught the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands.
To help this process Myellin sheath covers the Axon and improve speed neural impulses. Terminal buttons are really important to form junctions with other cells and guarantee all way to neural impulses, make connections with dendrites, its shape are perfectly designed to guarantee those connection. Another important compenent that most be mentioned is Cell body, also called as soma. This structure is responsabile for creates the messages made by electrical signal, knowed as action potential, that will pass through axon until other neurons. Although this consider only a cell, this looks like a complexy and fundamental struture to keep humam organism works in the right way."
"I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.
First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.
Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.
For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.
This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.
In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.
In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities."

"The solar panel is increasingly becoming popular today.However,do you know how it works?Then I will introduce this machine in the following sentences.
Firstly,look at its structure.It consists of one transparent top,one box,an inlet and an outlet.
Secondly,take on its working principles.When the sun rays are falling on the box through transparent top,the cool water entering the box through the inlet will be heated.After becoming warm by the sun rays,the water will flow out through the outlet.
Thirdly,it is just like a water dispenser from the structure.The former heats water by sun rays while the later works by the electricity.And the two kinds of energies don't generate pollution materials,which are the trend people seek in utilizing resources reasonably.
This kind of machine represents the advance of human beings'progress in exploring new energies.It is the results of diligent and relentless research of scientists.We should embrace the same kinds of home appliances in the future."
"The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.
Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.
Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.
In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework."
"The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.
The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.
According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.
In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out"
"While it is considered by some that young pupils should not be handed out assignments by their teachers, others strongly believe they are crucial for educational purposes. I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.
In regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.
By contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrens´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.
In conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only."
"My custom topic: https://www.ieltsluminary.com/post/island-before-and-after-the-construction
The diagram is of an island, prior to the introduction of tourism and afterward. The island is approximately less than 200 metres in length and a little under 80 metres in width.
Before the construction of tourist facilities, the island was desolated with no man made units whatsoever with vegetations sparsely grown in clumps all over the island. This changed after 15 housing units were constructed in 2 big circles on either side of the island. There is a reception building in the middle of the island and a restaurant up North. The barren land now have footpaths and vehicle tracks all around, increasing transport efficiency. The beach and the body of water near it has been turned into a swimming area. A pier has also been built on the South side of the island, with 2 sailboats docked.
Overall, there is a major increase in the number of housing units placed on the island and the number of footpath and vehicle tracks for a more efficient transport to the housing units, restaurant and beach. The East side of the island was untouched both before and after the construction of tourist facilities."
"My custom topic: It is important for people to take risks, in both their professional lives and personal lives.
Do the advantages of taking these risks outweigh the disadvantages?
I personally think that taking risks is inevitable in this day and age. There may be some drawbacks, but there it cannot be denied that there are certainly benefits.
Firstly, risks are necessary for us to move forward. Without risks, there would be no innovation, and without innovation, there will be no progress for humankind. Humankind is built on the foundation of risk-takers who not only achieved their goals of making the world a better place but also learnt to ability to get back up after their countless failures.
Secondly, by not taking the chance provided and taking a risk, they are missing out on amazing opportunities that could never be achieved unless you have the confidence, determination and conviction to follow the unknown path ahead. These opportunities could easily get them ahead in life, and they would never come true unless they stroll out of their conform zone.
Althought that is the case, it is undeniable that the amount of risk for professional and personal lives is vastly different. If they fail in their personal life, this could hurt in the short term, for example, you could need financial support if you had a family feud. This short-term loss could be a disadvantage in life, but it may not be as crucial as its effect on professional lives, for example, a career change could involve a big pay cut, which could be quite influential on professional lives.
Overall, taking risks could turn out to be a loss in the short term, but it is greatly outweighed by all the upsides taking a risk could bring."
"The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.the honey bee only spent 34-36 days in their all life. there are six steps to complete their life cycle。
Firstly，they life began from the egg which hatch after 9-10 days。After hatching，the little honey bee need takes 5 days to come out from egg。
Second，there have three important steps to being an young adult honey bee。Nymph moults 3 times as it grows。The smallest bee break away from egg to greet their first nymph moult will spent 7 days。The next nymph moult will come about 9 days later and the honey bee grows bigger。The young adult emerges when they complete the last nymph moult 。The young adult will spent 4 days to maturity。the matur female honey bee lay 1 or 2 eggs every three days and the life cycle of honey bee is finished。
Overall，the life of the honey bee is shot and wonderful。"
"This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.
Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.
Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.
Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy."
"The life cycle of the honey bee
The honey bee, is one of the friendly insects, it reproduces by ovulating, and give eggs.
This process ( honey bee's life cycle ) takes between thirty four to thirty six days.
The process starts with the female bee, female bee is the one that lays the eggs. It lays one or two eggs every three days, as it's written below.
A bee's egg is small and fragile, the bee puts it in a place where it won't fall or go with the wind.
As for the bee egg hatching mechanism, the egg needs to hatch after nine to ten days, in order to complete the growth of the little bee.
The bee hatches on the fifth day after leaving the egg, the young bee begins to grow up on its seventh day after the hatching stage.
The little bee turns into a nymph, and the nymph begins to milt three times as it grows.
Nymph grow and transform into a young adult bee, then the young adult bee needs four days to mature.
And it becomes a full growth bee and performs its functions in the nature.
And this process continues among the bees."
"The economic progress is an increase in the capability of a society to produce higher valued ( more and better ) goods and services with the use of the same or equivalent resources.
The benefits of economic growth include higher average incomes. Economic growth enables consumer to consume more goods and services and enjoy better standards of living.
The economic progress is an important goal for governments, because firstly, a healthy economy results in job creations, a high level of employment, and better salaries for all citizens. Secondly, economic progress ensures that more money is available for governments to spend on infrastructure and public services.
Another progress is important for a country, in my point of view, technical progress or technology in general is very important for a country, in many bases.
The technological progress refers to the discovery of new and improved methods of producing goods.
The term process technology refers to chemical processing used to refine raw materials into finished products. For example, process technology is used to refine crude oil.
Technological prosperity also lies in global purposes, so for military purposes and war technique, are important in terms of preparation and possessing advanced weapons.
And also for local and domestic or personal purposes, for example use of modern devices, and networks of the fifth generation ( 5G ).
There are many other types of important progresses, as industrial progress, architectural progress, commercial progress and civilization progress.
It all complements each other at the end. And all of them are of particular importance."
"The diagram explained how the life cycle of the honey bee.
Overall, it s a circular process which usually takes 34 to 36 days life cycle starting from female laying eggs to the young honey bee adult emerges.
To begin with, the life cycle of honey bee takes atleats 34 to 36days. The first stage is where the female honey bee lay 1 or 2 eggs every three days span, which then followed by hatching the eggs after 9 to 10 days before the bee breaks the egg after 5days. These are the stages where bee grows inside the egg.
The next stages of life cycle is where the honey bees grow outside the eggshells. After they are hatched, they start growing in size at 5 days and 9 days, and the nymph moults 3 times as it grows. Later 9 days, the young adults emerge which are ready for maturity in 4 days. It is clearly seen this then connected to female laying eggs"
"It is often argued that economic progress is the ultimate goal for most governments, while others suggest that there are other factors that contribute the country's progress. In my opinion, I believe that apart from economy, government should also consider other types of progress which also consider other types of progress which give equal importance to a nation.
first of all, it is widely believed that increase in gross domestic product is related to economic growth, which governments also think is their main aim to focus on. This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading. For example, an imported product is more expensive when compared with native product in terms of quality and manufacturing, where more money is invested by government. Therfore, governments main focus shouldn't be only on economy.
Desipte this, on the other hand,many argue that governments should also think about considering other types of progress which are as equal as economic progress. for instance, many countries are being recognized because of their education status and culture which attracts young stars to travel and study which in other terms also increase GDP. Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities. As a reason, the country's government should also focus more on other factors leading to progress.
In conclusion, I believe that government should not solely goal for economic growth but also concentrate on other factors which are equally important for a country's growth."
"The two illustrations descrive the floor plans of strudent accomodation. It is a comparison between 2010 and current. The building expanded slightly be increasing the number of student-bedroom, adding an en-suite room to one of the student rooms, and the carpark being provided.
In 2010, there were three student-bedrooms, currently, the location of those rooms remains the same. However, an en-suite room was added to the room located right at the end of the main entrance. Also, two more rooms were added to the building. The fourth room is located where livingroom used to be located back in 2010, and the fifth one on the left side of the fourth room. The livingroom does not exist in the current building. Also the area where the fifth student-room was built used to be a garden.
The location and the size of the bathroom and kitchen/social area remains the same between 2010 and now. Outside the building, on the south side, the car parking area was provided."
"Almost all big cities has residencial buildings these days, and people are able to live right in the middle of cities. It is convenient living in a big cities as you could be close to work, or have variety of choices when eating out, many people choose to live in a city. However, there are people who believe that there could be some health concerns by living in big cities. This could be ture to some extent, but I do not agree compeletely with this openion.
One of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings. This will encourage people to commute by public transportations. As a result, you could see less cars on the road in the cities.
There are also a health concerns coming from having less exercise. However, usually, ther are many gyms in the city. Also, many cities tend to have a big park or walking track, wher people can go for walks and jogs.
However, I agree that people living outside the cities, especialy wher surrounded by natures will have more cleaner air. Also having more space to exercise, compare to people living in cities may assist in being able to maintain their health.
Some people thinks that it is not good for people's health to live in big cities. However, environmental facts varies depending on each cities. I believe thath people can still live healthy as much as people living in a suburban areas, if the trafic is significantly heavy compare to other area of the coutries, of have an opportunities to exercise regularly."
"The provided illustrations depict the dormitory map in 2010 and current. Overall, shared areas were minimized and more rooms were built to increase the accommodation's capacity.
In 2010, the building was surrounded by a garden. There were 3 student bedrooms, each located away from the others. When entering the main entrance, the first student bedroom was on the left side, followed by the bathroom. At the end of the hallway, stood the second bedroom. Turning to the left, the last bedroom was on the other end with the kitchen in between the two bedrooms. If you turned another left, you would find the living room beside the bedroom.
Throughout the years, a carpark was built on the right side of the main entrance through the building's length. While the three student bedrooms remain the same, an additional en-suite room was constructed in the hallway beside the second bedroom. The kitchen is now integrated with the social area. Moreover, two more student bedrooms were built next to the third bedroom, one replacing the livingroom and another being developed over the garden area near the walkway."
"In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.
To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.
Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.
All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life."
"Two plans of a student accommodation buildings illustrate the layout of this site in 2010 and at present.
Overall, there have been noticable changes during this period of time in the student accommodation. It has been developed with a lot more bedrooms.
In 2010, the premises was surrounded by a lot of greenery, which has been replaced by more student-bedrooms and car parking now. There were only 3 bedrooms back in 2010, but at present there are 5 bedrooms including an en-suite room next to one of the bedrooms. There was no sign of car parking back in 2010.
Another major change that we can see from 2010 to at present is disappearance of the living room. However, a small area which is named as social area have come up in place of the living room. The social area is a part of the kitchen, which obviously made the kitchen smaller compared to that of 2010. Due to an en-suite room, the size of the hallway also has been reduced."
"It is believed that cities provide a better life in the comparsion of the life in a small town or a village. However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.
The main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.
Another reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health. Living in a continuous stress without taking care of the health leads to many health problems.
To conclude, the life in a big city is very stressful, busy and surrounded with a lot of pollution, which is not good for health of an individual."
"The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.
In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.
Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.
In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold"
"Never has the topic concerning citizens’ health failed to attract people’s attention. However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to people’s health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individuals’ health conditions.
Undoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitants’ health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.
However, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individuals’ mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.
Furthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizens’ health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizens’ health conditions can be diminished physically.
In conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individuals’ mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine people’s health."
"This scheme describes the changes in a structure of a student accomodation building between 2010 and present time.
The main entrance and the student-bedroom to the left of it remain the same. As for the garden to the right of the hallway, it was transformed to the car parking. The hallway area has reduced significantly due to the fresh built en-suite room that is now adjacent to the student-bedroom in the end of the hallway. The kitchen now includes a social area for students. The bathroom opposite to kitchen did not change at all. The living room left to the bathroom is now transformed to another student-bedroom with the passage leading to the room on the right, and its indoor entrance has shifted to the left. The part of the garden behind a former livingroom was turned into additional student-bedroom with two entraces: the first entry is located outdoors, while the second is available only indoors."
"There has been a lively discussion revolving around the megapolice influence on human health, as some people presume living in large cities results in a variety of problems. In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.
A row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.
On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.
To sum up, living in megapolice can possibly extend your life, but for me the quality of this life is still doubtful."
"The plans show how an accommodation building for students has changed from 2010 until the present.
In 2010 the under-roof housing plan was slightly smaller than what it is now. Previously, there were more outdoor garden areas. There has been various changes done under the roof as well. In 2010 the original design was to only have three student bedrooms with one bathroom to share. Now, the design shows that there are 5 bedrooms, four will need to share a bathroom and the fifth bedroom has an en-suit room.
To make the extra bedroom possible, the architect removed the living room and changed it into a bedroom. The kitchen now doubles up as a place to cook as well as socialize. The hallway is also slightly smaller to accommodate the en-suit room.
In 2010 there were three outdoor designated gardens. One at the back, one at the front and one on the left hand side of the student residence. Presently, there is only one at the back of the accommodation. The garden behind the residence is slightly longer, however, the outdoor area next to the living room does not exist. The garden area at the front is now a parking area for cars."
"To what extent can living in a large city be unhealthy?
Living in a large metropolitan can bring many challenges to one's health. When you live and work in a never-ending rat race there can be consequences to your health becasue of the continuous stress brought on by increased workload, longer working hours and very little time to rest.
There is also an increase in pollution due to the high density of people, cars and other carbon immisions.
I agree to an extent that living in a big city can bring about its challenges to your health, however, there are many more advantages to living in a major city when ones health takes a dip rather than being ill in a rural or outlying area. Getting sick and having health issues is not bound by an area you live in. These things happen to us no matter where we live. Living stress free in a rural area does not take away the fact that I may carry a cancer gene.
In my experience living in both an outlaying area and a city, when I needed to see a specialist for a health condition, I had to travel many hours to a doctor in the metropolitain area. These types of highly qualified doctors do not practise in rural areas or areas that are outside of a bit city. Generally speaking a specialist will be in a metro area where there is access to state of the art hospitals.
Do I believe that living in a city can bring on certain illnesses? Yes, defrinatly.
I would much rather live in a big city where all my health needs can be easily accessed rather than in an area out of the city where I may not get the medical attention I need."
"The plans show how an accommodation building for students has changed from 2010 until the present.
In 2010 the under-roof housing plan was slightly smaller than what it is now. Previously, there were more outdoor garden areas. There has been various changes done under the roof as well. In 2010 the original design was to only have three student bedrooms with one bathroom to share. Now, the design shows that there are 5 bedrooms, four will need to share a bathroom and the fifth bedroom has an en-suit room.
To make the extra bedroom possible, the architect removed the living room and changed it into a bedroom. The kitchen now doubles up as a place to cook as well as socialize. The hallway is also slightly smaller to accommodate the en-suit room.

"These pictures provide information about changes done to the museum between 1998 and 2008. The first one illustrate its condition in 1998 and second gives details from 2008.
According to the pictures, there has been significant alterations in some areas of museum whereas at some points no clear change has been done. Overall some areas benefited from an increase in total area and some exhibited decline in such category.
The areas taken from permanent exhibition rooms were allocated to form restarurant in the upper left corner of museum. In addition to that, some parts of the garden became cafe sitting area in front of the cafe. More than that, the fountains were added to the garden also. The WC part of the museum transferred to the place next to cafe and temporary exhibition room were moved to the left middle of the museum. Tickets and entrance and exit points showed no change with the exception of shop and bags and coat places changed to the left of the museum."
"Despite to the presence of vast amount of translation programs on computers and other electronic devices, it is still considered more beneficial in terms of learning language itself. In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.
The utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.
Another benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.
The third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.
In a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be."
"The figure illustrates the changes in museum space provided in 2008 in compatison with 1998. It can be clearly seen that the area of permanent exhibition was decresed and more additional facilities appeared.
Getting back to the details, facilities that had been placed to the right of the entrance were replaced by a part of permanent exhibition. Shop and room for keeping bags and coats were transfer to the left side instead room for temporary exhibitions and the new WC was opened inside cafe area. Tempopary exhibition room is currantly located to the left of garden and restaurant was opened juat beyond this exhibition room. The space of current temporary exhibition room and restaurant was previously occupied by permanent exhibition. So this space was decreased after modernisation of the museum.
The garden placed in the centre of the museum was also modernised. There are cafe sitting area and fountains now in the garden."
"Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work."
"The plan of a museum in 2008 had various changes comparing with the plan in 1998.The report will be divided into 2 sections. The first section is to summarising the information by selecting and reporting the main features.Making comparions where relevant is the main context in the second section.
Firstly,I am going to summarize the two plan comparatively.Viewing the plan in 1998,several large areas in the museum were for Permannent Exhibition Rooms,located in the both sides of the museum.The other funtions of the museum, such as Tickets Ebtrance,shop and so on, gathered in the south part of the museum.As for the plan in 2008, the Permannent Exhibition Rooms were placed in the east side of the museum.The other funtion were arranged in the east side.
Finally,I will make comparisons between them.The isolation of different funtions in the 2008's plan was clearer than the isolation in 1998's plan. What's more, comparing with the plan in 1998, 2008's garden had more functions,including cafe sitting area and fountains.
That'all my report."
"I totally agree with above opinion.With the development of the Internet technique and the receiving device.A lot of translation software are available.But I believe that learing a language personally is still necesssary for us.
I used to use translation software when I read essay and see a film.But It make me realize the importance of language learning that I made an academic mistake in my writing of the absract ,due to using the translation translated by softwate immidiately without checking,which make my pay in vain. I had to rewrite the abstract.However, my poor English made the process difficult.Having experienced that, I strongly feel that translation software is not the best way to use language.Only when languege stepping in our mind, can we use language truly.
The one of the main usage of language is communication,meanwhile,speaking is the most effective way to communicate with each other.If we comunicate with English speaker by using the translation software, it may be ineffective and even make miskakes.So if we have oppotunities to learn a languge,we should take action.
Translation software doesn't decline the need of language learning .opposively,it is benefit for the language learning.When we come across some words unknown,using,translation software is more convient than referring to the dictionary.
In a word,the wide use of the translation software dosen't mean that we don't need to learn language.What we should do is use the software critically with the accumulation with language learning.We are the owner of the tools ,not a slaver of a tool.We should keep our independace in some fields."
"The previous and current layouts of a museum were demonstrated in the pictures.
Overall, while the permanent exhibition room on the west side of the building was replaced by temporary exhibition room and a restaurant, the other permanent rooms on the east end were remained an deven enlarged. Additionally, the garden in the centre of the museum was renovated by adding fountains and a sitting area.
In the former plan of the museum in 1998, an entrance in the south side of the museum leads to a garden in the centre of area which was surrounded by large permanent exhibition room and a middle sized temporary exhibition room in the west end, two permanent exhibition rooms in the east side and a cafe in the north side. Next to the entrance, there is a space for a shop and a toilet.
Regarding to the changes in the present plan in 2008, the spacious permanent room was converted to a temporary exhibition room and a restaurant. The tickets area and garden remained in the same position. Nonetheless, the central garden was decorated by building two fountains and a cafe sitting area. The east wing of the complex was entirely allocated to three separate permanent exhibition rooms. Furthermore, the shop was moved to west side of the entrance, and the WC was rebuild next to cafe in the north end."
"Despite several translation programmes exist on different platforms, studying and acquiring the essential rules of a language has more benefits. Owing to limited usefulness of translation softwares in daily life, to large extent, ı agree with this statement. However, educationalists may use these programmes as supporting management systems for academical purposes.
A growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills. Individuals from different sociocultural or educational levels frequently utilise these open-access and easily understandable operating systems. Moreover, some teachers recommend their use to promote the learning process of primary school pupils. Last but not least, because translating a sheet by using these programmes is less time-consuming and free of charge, its use is gaining popularity among young individuals with regard to academic communication and correspondence.
On the other hand, the utility of these file management systems are questioned by some experts in the field of philology. Some linguistic scientists stated that translation supporting systems distracts children’s motivation and eagerness to learn the grammatical rules of a language. Additionally, while these operating tools have benefits in terms of easening the written communication, it has no practical advantage or use in verbal interaction. From my point of view, softwares should not be introduced to children before learning basics of a language and gaining an intermedicate level of spoken and written vocabulary.
In conclusion, although translation softwares have limited benefits such as costeffectivity and usability, it should be restricted as a complementary tool for people with a significant background and knowledge of a language, and the advantages of learning a language including practicality in face to face communication clearly outweighs."
"The figure shows plans of a museum in 1998 and in 2008, after suffering some changes. The main differences in both plans are the layout of the building and the addition of new facilities.
In 1998, once you entered the museum you would first encounter the entrance/ exit and the thickets shop. On the left, there was a temporary exhibition room and on the right, there was a shop, the bathroom and a bags and coat hanger.
At that time the museum had three permanent exhibition rooms: one on the left, next to the temporary exhibition room, and two on the right, adjacent to the shop and WC.
Separating 2 exhibition rooms, at the top of the plan, there was a cafe. All the spaces mentioned surrounded a central garden.
Similar to 1998, in 2008, people would find a ticket shop in the space designated as an entrance and exit. However, on the left, now is a permanent exhibition room, whereas on the right there's a shop and a bags and coat hanger. The museum still possesses three permanent exhibition rooms, all of them on the right side of the building.
On the left side, adjacent to the shop and hanger there's a temporary exhibition room and next to it a restaurant. At the top of the plan, there's a cafe and a bathroom next to the restaurant and one of the permanent exhibition rooms, respectively.
Just like in 1998, there's a central garden. However, this garden now has new components such as fountains and a cafe sitting area close to the cafe.
In conclusion, the museum in 2008 is much more modern and developed than in 1998. In fact, the building became a facility that welcomes not only people interested in visiting the many exhibitions but also those that just want to have a meal or a cup of coffee in the garden with friends."
"In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.
First of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.
In fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.
Furthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.
One of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, ""Saudade"" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.
Besides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.
Lastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.
To illustrate this, when talking to the AI ""Siri"" on the iPhone or ""Alexa"" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.
In conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated."
"The picture illustrates different areas of a museum in 1998 and alterations made in 2008.
The museum consists of a garden located in the heart of the plan, with exhibition rooms, tickets entrance, shop, toilet, cafe, and bags and coats surrounded by.
Take a look of the plan, in 1998, most of the areas in museum were permanent exhibition rooms and a garden in the center of it, however in 2008 exhibition rooms originally on the left side had been replaced with restaurant, temporary exhibition room, bags and coats, and finally the shop.
Although garden maintains the same but be added with cafe sitting area and 2 fountains and parts of the area of cafe was distributed to WC after alterations in 2008.
Currently, all of the permanent exhibition rooms are on the right side of the museum while others are on the left. Bags and coats , temporary exhibition room occupy a larger area than before the renovation of the museum."
"Learning a language seems to be an advantage even though there are plenty of translation softwares can be accessed to in this era. I certainly agree that the benefits of acquiring a new language still outweigh that of using translation apps because it is a systematic learning and it is able to improve your competitiveness rather than rely on translating tools.
To learn a language, we must start form vocabulary and grammar then goes to the process of making up a sentence. In the initial stage it would be difficult to master the pronounciation but once you overcome this part, you are actually acquire the skills of using a foreign language naturally. Moreover, through the learning process, you are trying to gain permanent memory of it which won't let you forget the spelling of a word so soon. For example, language laerners usually perform well in certain areas such as academic or business field via lots of practices and trainings and they attribute to their hardwork instead of translating tools.
Using translation software is not a bad thing and the fact is they are available in these days yet heavy reliance on it can not bring you as much benefits as learning languages step by step. I can not deny that these tools are convenient and easy to use, however it may restrict our level of learning outcome from it function- translating word by word, which is usually lead to the result of wrong meaning of a sentence. Many learners, on the other hand trying to translating every text while they are reading an article, it may be useful to conquer the hardships initially, but in the long run they may forget all the contents since they are not memorize the meanings of a word and just let it go after the reading. The result is that they are underperforming because lack of training and unable to interprete the definition of words.
To summarize, I agree that learning a language still can be advantegeous than just simply searching for the translation by apps no matter how convenient the tools are. Once you really learn something and internalize into your life, than you are able to being outstanding than those who are not."

"The diagrams show two different floor plans for a Musuem. Both diagrams show that the Entrance/Exit and ticketing space stayed the same in 2008 as in 1998. On the right of the ticketing counter for the 1998 floor plan we see spaces split for the shop, WC, and storage space for bags and coats. The temporary exhibition room is located on the left of the entrance/exit and seems smaller in 1998 as compared to the area we see for the temporary exhibition room we see in the 2008 plans. The 2008 floor plan shows the shifting of the storage space for bags and coats and the shop to the left of the ticketing counters. The right hand side space in the 2008 plans is being used as part of the permanent exhibition rooms.
The 1998 floor plans show that the permanent exhibition rooms, and the cafe, as well as the temporary exhibition room, ticketing counter, and shop were situated around a central garden. The cafe split the permanent exhibition rooms into two sides of the garden. The 2008 changes in the plans indicate that while the permanent exhibition rooms were moved to be on right side of the garden, a portion of garden was carved out to work as a sitting area for the cafe. A restaurant was also added next to the cafe right past the temporary exhibition room which is now sits on the other left side of the garden. The garden was renovated to include two new water features in the form of fountains. The WC is now located next to the cafe adjoining the permanent exhibition rooms."
"Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill."
"The provided bar chart presents the mobile phone revenue of market-dominated brands including Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013.
Overall, the mobile phone market was mainly dominated Samsung and Nokia, whereas Apple's sales witnessed a significant surge in these periods.
To delve deeper, in 2009, Nokia was the biggest brand that gain the most revenue about $440mn, followed by Samsung $230mn and LG $120mn, respectively. Meanwhile, Apple was the least market share with about $25mn of sales.
However, we can see that Samsung got the great performance and taken down the Nokia to be the biggest brand in 2013, they got $450mn of revenue compared to $250mn by Nokia. Apple was the 3rd rank which gain sales exceed the LG also, $150mn and $80mb, respetively. Note that ZTE revenue was steadily in the periods about $50mn - $60mn in the periods."
"Nowadays, our world has face challenges to rapidly changing many things, and this lead to well-being in our daily life. Some argue that routine behavior is adequate for spending their life, by others do not agree with this thought. This essay will attempt to provide a brief analysis.
First of all, it is a fact that people feel comfortable to being and doing things that they being familiar with, by fixing routine in every day we can make our life certain and manageable. For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field. This helps people to reduce the risk of facing things we not prefer.
However, all of the creatures has to develop and adapt to an environment to survive in this crucial world and not even human, this important for us to leave our comfort zone in some situation. Encouraging new challenges in life could give us to develop and explore new skills or new ways of thought. From my experience, I recently tried to play a new sport that I never thought I will in love with, which is golf. It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.
In summary, I would say that the advantage of doing new things outweigh the disadvantage of its. Sometimes we have to take a risk to walk in the alternative way, maybe we could get new goolife we could never imagine for"
"The bart chart shows us the quantity of phone which are sales by brand at every 2 years.
Both, Nokia and Samsung have the biggest part of the market . Conversely, the thirds others brands, sold few mobile so far.
Firstly, Samsung increased these own sales each by at least 20, from 230 in 2019 to 450 in 2013. On the other hand, Nokia started with roughtly 450 in 2009 to drop out sharply to 250 in 2013.
On the other side, Apple began with a little bit quantity from 25 to go up to 150. In comparison, LG drop down until 80. In overwhole, global sales of ZTE remain the same between these three years, with between 50 and 60 of phone sales.
To conclude, the graph shows us, 2 majors concurent in the market and in the other side, 3 brands who try to catch up part of the market."
"It is difficult to establish new routine, but sometime it is important. Some people think, that is it important to change our daily life. Conversely, other thinks that does not matter at all and, do not want to change. In my point of view, I think it is difficult to change. However, we have a lot of environmental issues last decade, therefore, we need to change.
Learn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.
On the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.
To conclude, to change is important because in our century we have big issues. But as we seen there are no explicit reason to change if there are no problem and we are happy in our life."
"The bar chart below illustrates the sales on five different mobile phones brand (Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG, ZTE)on a global scale between the years 2009 and 2013.
Overall, it is clear that the brands, the most sold were Samsung and Nokia while Apple, LG and ZTE were the least sold. However, Samsung, Apple and ZTE showed an increase in their sales, meanwhile Nokia and LG decreased throughout the years.
Samsung increased significantly its sales going from around 200 in 2009, reaching 450 in 2013. In 2009, Apple had almost zero sales in 2009, but went up gradually reaching in 2011 almost 100 sales and in 2013 the trading went up to 150. The value of ZTE, remain steady throughtout the years; in 2009 was 50 and in the final year was a slightly above 50.
In 2009, Nokia was first in the market sales with almost 450 sales and a little below 450 in 2011(showing a slight decrease), however in 2013 the sales drop drastically to 250. Lg, had a little above 100 sales in 2009, but this value decreased slowly throught the years going under 100 in 2011 and again 2013."
"Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.
Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.
Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.
In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing."
"This bar chart descraibe the sales of diffrent brand on phone of the period of 2009, 2011 and 2013.
Overall, it can be clearly seen from the chart there is highest and lowest sales between the company and there big challings from this brands.
First of all, Samsong and Nokia the two large sales on the year of 2009, even when see the samsong have the more little high but it is close to other.
While, when continue on same year will see how Apple have the low sales between other brands. But if focus for this company will notes that the sales become high year after years and that descraibe the Apple work on this devise and the represintive fot iphone.
To sum up, there is a big challinge between Samsung, Apple, Nokia LG and ZTE. Also can clearly see some company lost while the other take more sales for devises they have."
"These dayes some humans think the fixed routine it is comfort, while the other belive the change between days it is better. This essay will descraibe both saids and draw my personal conclusion.
First of all, when we live on same schudale for all days that mean the tommorw we know what we do. For example, the person he work on any spicalist and he know what will do next day because it is same like the week before, and he like that and feel comforte for his live. So in the end, the fixed routine that will be the goal for some people.
Second of all, when the next day or next week it is not the same of this moment or before! that descraibe there is new experince or maybe new challinges will be see that front of us. To illustrate, many men or womans they likes to wake up on the morning to see what they have new for those day. And for this people they get more energy and very excited for the new morning on they lives.
In addition, I saw some persons they like when they in work want to live on same routine but on weekend they belived the change is better to got or put new information, experince, or anything that diffrent for the bast week. So, they like the routine and change.
In conclusion, after carfuly analysis, I belive the change it is better for me and for humanity because there is so many thing we must to be learn about it and that will be come when we change or routine."
"Flooding is a serious problem that affetcs people all arround the world, it can destroy entire communities and end people lives. Natural catastrofes like flooding, huracanes and many others don´t occure every day, anticipation is key. The diagrams show how houses can be protected in areas wich are prone to flooding.
The diagrams show on the one hand where there is a stopbank and on the other hand where there is no stopbank. To raise buildings ais very important in this matter. Ground level and flood level must be taken in account.
The starting point is the ground level that must be mesure against the 100-year flood level. The boulding must be raised from the ground level so that the house florr level is 300 mm above the 100-year flood level. The river/dam and the internal runoff are the extreme factores.
Both diagrams show how to prevent bouldings from flooding with the main difference of of the stopbank."
"There are several systems of education, some of them more efficients than others. Students of today are the proffessionals of tomorrow and thus is very important they recibe a propper education. In my opinion we should divide students based on their academic ability.
If we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.
On the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.
Education should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.
In my personal expirience I shared classrooms with students that had special needs and teachers educate them in different ways than the rest of as. These special students have different learning times and needed more atenttion from their teachers. On the other hand, some students were very smart with great academic abilities and some of them had some behaviour troubles becouse they got bored at class, I remmember one student named Jackson Bell who was brilliant and was sent to the school physicologist due to behaviour problems(he hit other students) and if teachers have gaived Jackson the extra attention he needed that wouldn´t happen."
"This picture illustrates the importance of the stopbank in protecting houses located in areas where flooding occurs often.
In particular, the first image explains how level of water can be lowered thanks to a stopbank, which consists in an increase level of the ground. The presence of the stopbank allow a reduction of the water level. Moreover, another relevant feature of the stopbank is the presence of the floodgate. This makes possible the exit of the water in excess. Indeed, internal runoff could cause an incontrolled increase of the water level. Thus, the floodgate is very important to mantain stable the level of water. Regardless of the presence of the stopbank, buildings should not touch the ground. They should be elevated in order to allow a higher level of the water without causing damages to the houses.
In conclusion, it seems clear that a stopbanck could be a safeguards for buildings which are built in areas prone to flooding."
"Nowadays, a topic often discussed is the education and its relation with the difference in people's ability and possibilities. According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.
People that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.
The other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the ""best"" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.
To conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability. But if you want to educate people as humankind you should not divide the class."
"The given picture represents the way how houses around the coastline could be prevented from the flood.
Overall, there are two ways to do this. The first one is using a stopbank. The other one is raising the house under the 100 year flood level. Also we can use a mix of them.
According to the picture, the stopbank is a useful way to prevent flooding by building a little dump between the house and the river. Before constructing it we should know the level of the flood around the previous 100 years and our dump should be higher. Moreover, the stopbank will make an internal pond which will be created by internal runoff, accordingly we should give water to return back to the river via floodgate.
Additionally, it is shown that we could use piles to raise a building above water. In doing this we should carry about 300 mm freeboard between the house flood and the water level."
"Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.
On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.
On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.
In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea."
"Both diagrams involve a 100-year flood level, both diagrams tell us that a raised building is involved, there's a freeboard of 30mm, the building is raised and both diagrams show that there's flooding involved. However for diagram 1 it tells us that the water level is closer to the ground as compared to diagram 2 so that means it's less likely for the house to get destroyed in diagram 1 compared to diagram 2 this is because there's a stopbank present in diagram 1 to reduce the amount of flooding. The Berm in diagram 1 allows the water to take a steeper path so that it reduces the risk of flooding so that the house in diagram 1 is less likely to get destroyed as compared to the house in diagram 2. In diagram 1 there's a floodgate to control the amount of water flowing and it's not present in diagram 2."
"I believe students should be divided according to their academic ability this is because specific students require different amounts of support according to their abilities.
Students that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.
However if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.
If students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.
However if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.
Overall I believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated, they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support."
"The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.
The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’
If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’"
"Nowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.
Proponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet students’ needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each student’s maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.
Others, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each student’s academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for children’s all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.
In conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngsters’ gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead."
"The suggested plan of the ground floor plan of this house has been illustrated in the diagram. It shows the already existing floor plan and the proposed changes made to the floor plan.
Overall, the main changes that have been made, is that the hall has been removed from the floor to enhance the space of the living room. Meanwhile the kitchen have added furniture in the changed diagram and the doors leading through the kitchen to the living room has changed location.
The kitchen in the existing floor plan contained no furniture. Meanwhile the proposed changes to the kitchen added furniture, but made the kitchen overall smaller. The hallway has been completely removed in the revised floor plan, making room for double doors leading into the living room. These alterations in the structure of the floor has expanded the area of the living room, making it more spacious than in the existing floor plan.
In conclusion, these changes would remove the hallway from the floor making the living room overall larger."
"There are a lot of different opinions regarding the teaching of children and what is best for a childs developement. Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.
The most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.
The other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.
In conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home. I hold this opinion since school attendance can enhance childrens social skills and their ability to navigate the world around them."
"The diagram illustrates suggested impovements planned for the ground floor of a building
The hall in the middle of the floor will be removed and the respective space will be added to the living room. Therefore, there will be no more wall between the living room and that area that is occupied by the hall at the moment. At the same time the wall between the living room and the kitchen as well as stairs will be moved towards the windowless wall and stairs will be reformatted in a spiral shape.
Some other less important changes will include installation of kitchen furniture in the kitchen, deployment of 2-pieces door between the living room and the kitchen and removal of the storage space under stairs.
In conclusion, it can be stated that the most important change to the ground floor will be it reformatting into 2 rooms. Some other changes will be also implemented with regards to the walls, doors and other items."
"There is no agreement between supporters of the school and home education. While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.
On the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.
On the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.
In conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home"
"The given diagrams illustrate to projects of a ground floor of a house. The first one show the floor how is it now while the second shows the proposed plan for some changes.
Overall, the main work will be focused in the hall area with the purpose to create more space and connect the living room with the hall and in the kitchen where a new section is added.
To have more space, the left wall along with the storage is going to be removed. Doing so, the stairs are going to be positioned right in front of the entrance, where internal doors are now.
Dividing the kitchen from the right area, are going to be the internal doors that are going to be positioned at the right of the entrance and the right internal wall. Also, as a result, to access the kitchen is going to be through the internal doors. An element that is added at this plan is the kitchen furniture that is left to the kitchen."
"For some people home schooling is considered to be the right decision for kid's development, meanwhile other people believe that is important to send children to school. I think that sending children to school give them a great advantage not only in their academics but also in their development and social skills.
Having children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.
On the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.
However, in my personal experiece being in a class with a lot of students can be hard. Find the ""right people"" to be with might be challenging but at the end it is satisfying, because you might also end up having friends for life and creating good memories,
In conclusion, these two different methods are both acceptable, as long as the child best interest is done, no matter if his being teached at school or at home."
"The diagrams illustrate the ages and the amount of people of different genders who took part in a variety of evening programs at an educational center in a certain year.
It is conspicuous that there were remarkable differences in the categories of courses that men and women chose. To be more specific, the largest difference could be seen in the language course where the numbers of males and females were 20 and 40 respectively. Then it was followed by the data in drama where the number of women was 20 while the number of men was 10. The opposite could be seen in the figures of two genders in the sculpture course where the amount of men outnumbered that of women, being at 10 and about 6 separately.
As for the divergent age groups who joined these courses, people who aged 50 or over consisted the largest proportion with its figure at 42%. Next came the data of individuals aged at 40-49 being at 26%. The resemblance could be found in the percentages of people in the age groups of 30-39 and 20-29, which accounted for 16% and 11% separately. On the contrary, the smallest data could be seen in the age group of aged under 20, which only comprised 5%.
To sum up, the amount of women who preferred the language course far exceeded that of men while the number of men outnumbered women in the sculpture course. Besides, people who aged over 50 liked attending the evening courses."
"The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.
Undoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.
On the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.
To sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option."
"The bar graph illustrates how many women and men attended drama, painting, sculpture and language courses in 2009 at an adult education centre while the pie chart provides data in regard to the ages of the course takers.
Overall, most women than men attended drama, painting and language courses and sculpture reported in general, the less number of people enrolled. Overall, people aged 50 or over participate to the indicated evening courses while people under 20 are the minority.
According to the bar graph, only 10 men attend drama classes while for women the number double up. The painting course shows a slight difference between the number of men and women participating, above 20 for men and 30 for women. The language course report on average the highest number of people enrolled, 20 men and 40 women. Sculpure has the lowest number of attandences.
The pie chart illustrates that mostly people aged 50 or over attended those evening courses, 42% respectively. to follow, 26% of the enrolled people are aged between 40 and 49 years old. A slight difference of percentage there's among people aged 30-39 and 20-29, 16% and 11% respectively, Only the 5% of the people is aged under 20."
"Some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
During the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
To sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage."
"The given graphs illustrate the gender (bar chart) and age (pie chart) distributions of adult people that attended different evening courses at an education centre in 2009.
Overall, we can see that, generally, there were more women than men in each class (excepted in sculpture) and the majority of partcipants were 50 years old or over.
Language course was the most popular one, with 60 people (40 females and half males), while sculpture had the lowest number of participants (10 men and almost 5 women). Painting and drama lessons were the second and the third most popular classes, respectively. In particular, 30 females and nearly 25 males chose painting, while 20 women and 10 men prefered drama class.
Furthermore, looking at the pie chart it is clear that only a small number of young people attended these courses (16% of under 29). On the contrary, the 42% of people was 50 or over and the 26% was between 40 and 49 years old. The last 16% was represented by people from 30 to 39 years old."
"Thanks to the modern society, people feel free to behave more naturally than before, without the necessity of hiding aspects of their personal life, such as the sexual orientation. For that reason, the number of omosexual women and men seems to increas and some people are worried about the impact that this could have on the society. In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.
Nowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.
Furthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.
Considering the above point, I think that people should have the right to choose from their own who to share their life with, without any legal restriction. In order to allow that, the governement should legalize the marriage between gay couples."
"Information about the number of participants in evening courses in 2009 (either women or men) is provided by the bar chart, whereas the pie chart focuses on the age of those people.
Overall what stands out is that language courses are the most attended ones by women with 40 participants, 10 more than the painting courses among women, whereas for men it is close between painting and languages with 25 and 20 participants, respectivly. As far as the age group of them goes, most of them are over 50 with the staggering 42% which is 16% more than the second most popular age group which is people betweem 40 and 49 years of age.
Furthermore, men had 10 participants in both drama and sculpture classes, whereas women had double that in drama courses and only 5 in sculpture. People between the age of 30 and 39 made up 16% of participants, while 11% were from 20 to 29 years of age and those aged under 20 came up to only 5% of all people."
"Gay marriages are becoming a very relevant topic of discussion because of the mixed opinions surrounding it. Some people firmly believe that they are bad for society, whereas others preach that people should be free to choose the person they want to be with for the rest of their life, regardless of gender. I endorse freedom of choice and following your heart and for those reasons I support the idea of gay marriages being legal and widly accepeted.
In today's world people are thought to treat everyone equally, to accept other people's desires and opinion and not to judge them based on that. Morals that did not exist in that past. Happiness should not be judged or illegal. When a person is happy he will want to give back and help others by, for example, volunteering and solving public issues and participating in charity organisations.
Furthermore, the acceptance of gay marriages has other great effects. For example, gay people biologially cannot have offspring. This has two main benefits . Firstly, world population is growing at an alarming rate and gay marriages help lower that rate of birth because of their biological nature. Secondly, if a gay couple decides that they want to have a child, they can addopt one. That is great because nowadays orphanages are a shellter for many kids who do not have a family.
In conlusion, the acceptance of gay marriages is improtant both morally, to allow individuals to embrace their true nature and desires and not oppress them, and politically because it can potentially help solve an issue that is possing a great threat to the world we live in."
"The bar chart depicts the figure for men and women who joined four different evening classes at an adult education center in 2009 while the pie chart illustrates the proportion of participants’ age, divided into five groups.
Overall, it can be seen that women participated more than men in every course, except sculpture. Additionally, the majority of the classes was elders who were 50 years old or over.
Looking at the detail, painting and language were the most popular subject among men and women respectively. Moreover, females joined drama and painting more than males by 10 people. For language course, 20 men attended the class while the number of women were two times higher than that of men, accounting for 40 people. On the other hand, sculpture was the least popular among women and the figure for women participating in this class was lower than the number of men by 10 people.
Regarding ages, 68% of the participants were people over 40 years old, 26% for the 40-49 age group and 42% for the over-50 age group. The remaining 32% was people under 39 years old, including 5% of children who were under 20 years old which was the minority group."
"There is an argument regarding gay marriage whether this type of marriage will negatively affect on communities, or it is a natural preference and right for everyone. I am of opinion that gay marriage should be legal and the reason will be outlined below.
To begin with, nowadays, human equality is becoming more and more important. Hence, men should have the right to marry a person with the same gender. Since this right is one of the fundamental living, governments should revise the law to reflect this type of marriage and enforce it accordingly. This is exemplified by developed countries, which pay attention to human rights, allowing a man to marry another man legally.
Furthermore, gay marriage will not be likely to cause negative effects on societies. On the other hand, this trend tends to increase countries’ economic growth. As a result of implementing the policy which promote same-sex marriage, gay couple around the world tend to be attracted by this government support, and possibly move and live in the country. To illustrate this, there is research demonstrating that the economy of Canada has been growing substantially after allowing gay marriage to be legal.
In conclusion, it seems to me that gay marriage should be legal due to the human right and the positive consequent which possibly contribute to the potential rising in countries’ economy."

"The bar chart illustrates the quantity of male and female attendance of different evening classes at a centre of adult education over the year 2009, while rates of age groups of the centre attendee are represented in the pie chart.
Overall, it is clear from the first chart that women tended to take part in varying courses more than men, especially this difference is noticeable in the results of language learning studies. From the second chart, it is obvious that such activities were mostly visited by older people, which means the older person was in 2009 the bigger proportion one had in visiting.
Firstly, opposite sexes differed in the frequency of attendance and in their preferred courses. Women were the most likely to study language at the centre and their amount increased to 40, while results for men showed that they were coming the most to painting activities, and the number of men in that class was around 25. Besides, the courses that reached a minimum in female attending were drama and sculpture classes with 10 female students each. However, the number of males attending fell to the lowest number for the sculpture course.
Secondly, the age groups have various percentages during 2009. The majority of people at the adult education centre, which made up 42%, were more than 50 years old. In contrast, students who were above 20 form only 5% of the total. Also, the big chunk of attendees were men and women aged from 40 to 49 put together 26%."
"The scenario of two people getting married was always welcomed in society but not if those two are of the same sex. This question remains quite arguable currently. A part of the population tends to have the opinion that gay marriage could affect the community in a destructive way, while the other part sees this perspective as the development of social nature, freedoms, and basic human rights. I believe that every individual person has the own will to decide for themselves who they want to marry, overall, other people are not the ones to make a decision.
First of all, it is widely recognized that conservative and religious societies have a low tolerance for gay marriage because it can destroy their core values and outlook in life. It is generally known that such people think that the legalization of gay marriage can lead to the devaluation of heterosexual couples and their marriage, which is extremely harmful to the community. For example, there is one opinion widely spread in Utah that such legalization can devalue heterosexual marriage, which will lead to an active extramarital sex life, and therefore to a wild increase in the number of abortions. So, it is clear that gay marriage can be adverse.
On the other hand, forbidding marriages that are not heterosexual equals ignoring the basic rights and freedoms of every person. Besides, the research in Utah shows that the previously mentioned fear is completely irrational and Global Health Organization declared that being homosexual is not one of the mental problems. When couples live together and love each other but can not be bounded by official documents, it can cause a lot of legal problems. For instance, when one of them is in the hospital in critical condition, the other can not make a decision about treating or even visiting a beloved one due to the fact that they are not legally related. Such conditions could lead even to fatal consequences.
In conclusion, I believe that each individual person can have their own opinion, but this should not affect other people's lives in a negative way. That`s why I think that homosexual marriages should be legalized."
"we can see below a pie chart for different ways of dealing with dangerous wastes in different countries.
recycling seems to be the most popular way of disposing of wastes in republic of korea, taking 55%. but as you study the percentages in sweden and united kindom, you fin they have considerably far less popularity. since recycling might be expensive, underground digging may be found very economical for the united kingdom, with 82% of it's waste being dealed with by underground digging. again, underground digging has the greatest percentage in the united kingdom. united kingdom does have a remarkable fourth category which the other two ocuntries seem to lack, albeit a dangerous one for marine life; dumping at sea, which equally matches chemical treatment percentage. moving on to sweden, it seems underground dominates the chart.
while re-checking the overall pie charts given, sweden seems to be the most ordered of the three, being one of he most developed countries in the world."
"""Some people tend to think that the government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children""
with that sounding strongly controversial, with no middle grounds to meet, I might as well take a side. no. I don't think this sounds logical.
throwing your parental responisbilities on outside factors such as 'government' or 'a universal conspiracy' is merely being paranoid. the government does not benefit from creating obese children, nor do they have the leisure time for such idiotic problems. point such allegations on business companies, it sounds more believable.
whenever obesity is mentioned, my mind jumps into the bigger picture of children given allowances, of which they barely save from and continuously spend on unhealthy food. that, my dear, is the reason for obesity. lack of observation, lack of strict rules, lack of awareness. as a mother, it is important to monitor your children's diet and health. it is equally important to give them a good space to play sports in, which would greatly decrease obesity rate. assuming that the government has a hand in such trivial matters, they won't control you from looking after your children properly. that, as well as a point metioned previously: what do they benefit? spending money and effort and time on, lets say, sponsors to attract children to candy, funding children sweets, and sponsoring for attractive street food to engrave the constant need for those in a child's mind. the question is, what do they gain in return? it is foolish to fund that that doesn't give back equal benefit
so let's state it again, only a foolish government is responsible for the rise of obesity in children"
"The three pie graphs provide information on which methods is used to deal with hazardous waste products by Republic of Korea, Sweden and the UK.
Overall, the main stricking feature is that every countries has a primary way to engage with dangerous end-of-life materials, despite using equally all of them.
The specialisation is particulary clear in the UK where the waste burryed underground cover 82% of the total, whereas in both Republic of korea and Sweden the main way of dealing with it is less then three-quarters of the total. Although for the UK and Sweden the method used is dump the materials underground, Republic of Korea favorites recycling, a process that is not used in the UK and covers only 25% in Sweden.
It is also evident that Republic of Korea and Sweden proceed in two secondary ways, which sees incineration as a last resources (9% and 20% respectively), while the 18% of the UK uncoverd by the undergorund method is split evenly between chemical treatment and dumping at sea (processes not empolyed by the other nations) and only a mere 2% get destroyed by fire."
"In today's society, obesity in youngster has become a crucial matter for the health system after noticing the skyrocketing rates. It is argued that the government should be held solely responsable for this pandemic, but I personally disagree with this statement.
The government is already taking measures to prevent this devastating issue. Firstly, it is promoting numerous campaigns against obersity at a young age showing the detrimental effects that this condition can trig in a life time with the terrific consequences. Moreover, authorities are trying to correct unhealthy habits, taxing sugar in drinks and foods and removing sweet and high fat products from public areas, such as schools and hospitals. Therefore, Government can be consider highly active on confining the increased percentage of overweight children.
Not only ministries are exstensively advertising health pattern to control weight and discourage consumption of toxic products, but they are also involving the communities in outdoor events, such as presenting the new city soccer team. So that, while promoting sports and active lifestyle, youngster can be influenced by these athletes to pursue a better physical conditions. Nevertheless, government is promptly enhancing the importance of personal training class in primary school offering schoolars the possibility of choosing gym as extra class to add to their curriculum.
To conclude, although obesity rates are rapidly raising, I do not agree that government is responsible of this outcome. Clearly, it is broadly active engaging children in outdoor activities, yet limiting products from public areas. Hence, authorities are commiting to prevent this plague that could have horrible consequences on future adults."
"The bar charts illustrate five different methods of how the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the UK deal with waste products. The five methods are recycling, underground, incineration, chemical treatment, and dumping at sea.
overall, recycling is way more in Korea while underground dumping took first place in both Sweden and the UK.
First, Morethan two third of the waste is recycled in Korea while incineration is more than half in Sweden. Korea dumps 22% under the ground and incinerated less than 10%. Sweden, on the other hand, recycled a quarter of its waste but incinerated a fifth of the garbage.
Second, the UK dumps most of its waste under the ground incinerating only 2%. Chemical treatment and dumping at sea both share 8% of the UK's waste product."
"Obesity among children has risen in the past years. Parents and government share the responsibility to keep children well-being. This essay will discuss reasons and examples of how both sides have responsibilities toward the children.
To begin with, Politicians should have an obligation to legislate laws that stop some food companies from selling high-calorie diets in the country. Laws toward diet companies should ban them from increasing sweeteners in candies to rise profits. In the same manner, the government has a duty to build outdoor play-ground and clubs to help parents raise healthy kids. Gardens should be grown to overcome obesity. In the UAE each block in the city has its own garden and playground. Research in the Netherlands shows a huge decline in obese children after the government renewed old playgrounds.
Parents on the other hand share a tremendously important rule. Parents should encourage their children to practice sports and substitute bad habits. Pampering the kids with a sweetened diet should be stopped. Parents should read about the effect of obesity on their kids' health. For example, simple sugar rise the glucose level rapidly causing the unexpected energetic status of the kid before bedtime. Some medical cases were seen among children related to obesity like cardio-pulmonary illnesses. If the parents were aware of these consequences they would discourage the bad habits of their children.
To sum up, government do its role in keeping the kids' wellness by building institutions and providing laws on their behalf. Also, parents should educate themselves and their children, and stop unnecessary food habits."
"There are 3 pie charts showing how harmful waste products are utilized in Republic of Korea, Sweden and United Kingdom. As ways of dealing recycling, chemical treatment, underground, dumping at sea and incineration are presented.
More than a half of dangerous waste products are undergrounded in Sweden. Other parts are recycled and incinerated in proportion 25 to 20 accordingly. On the other hand, 69 percent of the rubbish is recycled in Republic of Korea, and only 9 percent is incinerated. Others are undergrounded. In United Kingdom 8 percent of dangerous waste products are chemical treated. The same part is dumping at sea. The majority is undergrounded. The smallest amount of the harmful rubbish in U.K. is incinerated. This part is only 2 percent of all amount of dangerous waste products in the country.
Comparing these 3 charts, it is possible to conclude that the biggest fraction of harmful rubbish is undergrounded in United Kingdom. The smallest one is in Republic of Korea. There 69 percent of the waste products are recycled. The smallest fraction of incinerated products is presented in United Kingdom. Meanwhile, this fraction in Sweden is equal to 20 percent. The most various chart is shown in United Kingdoms, because it includes either Chemical treatment and dumping at sea."
"It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.
First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children."
"The given chart illustrates the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984. The information is segregated by sex.
Overall it can be seen the huge difference between the structures of the populations of France and India, whereas in France the highest percentage of population were between 0 and 40 years old, in India the highest percentage of population were found at the age rate of 0 to 30 years old. In France there were females and male that reached 85 years old whilst in India no one survived more than 70 years.
To summarise in France 15% of the total popultaion would reach 65 years old or more,when in India the age limit as mentioned before is 70 years old and only 10% of the population would reach more than 60 years old. Furthermore in India the percentage of people from 0 to 15 years old doubles the percentage of population in thta same age rate in France."
"The next essay will talk about the reasons behind the need of some people to find out about their own family history.
I believe in certain young countries as USA for example, it is completely logical to feel the need of getting to know where your roots come from.
We have to take into account that in many cases a sector of the USA population only know the nationality or the history of their grandparents, and their grandparents have very few information of their own parents, so the total history of their family is quite sort. I am spanish and lived for one year in the state of Washington with an american family. It was very surprising for me to find out how proud that family was of its european roots. It took me a while to understand their feelings. I needed to put myself into their shoes. To give a live example, my american Dad had even visited the northern part of Norway, close to the Artic Polar Circle to look for a distant cousin he had figured out he had. My american Dad was the happiest person on earth when showing the picture of his cousin and him taking a beer in Norway.
I believe there are many reasons for someone to dig into history to have a deeper knowledge of his own family. Firstly you may get a better understanding of the behaviours of your closest relatives. Also you can find the reasons behind the colour of your skin or your eyes.
To summarise, I strongly believe it is positive to get to know more about your own roots and about your distant relatives to get a better understanding of youself."
"The charts show two different structures of the population in two countries: France and India.
At first look, the main difference is in maximum ages in France and India. When highest mark for France is above 85 years old, for India this level is just above 75 years old. It could be related with many factors, but especially with life condition in these countries.
Another very markable difference is shape of the charts. India chart has shape of triangle, it means that there are linear dependence between ""Percent"" and age. Also, we can notice, that proportion of male and female is almost equal for Indian people. France chart has more complicated structure. The bottom of the chart has square shape, so the the amount of people is almost equal for each group below 35, then chart has shape of triangle as a India chart. Also, there is intresting mark at the top: for group above 85 years old, ""Percent"" of women is several time higher then men. It could be related with wide range of aspects."
"Some people nowdays are really interested in finding out their families history. There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.
But why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.
In my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.
To summarise, finding out one's family history has two main reasons. In my opinion, it is really good, that people are intresting in their famillies history."
"Information about the age distribution of the population of France and India is provided in the diagram in percentages.
Overall, in India the older the age group the smaller the portion of the population it is, whereas in France it is a lot more balanced.
Values between the age groups of the population do not differ in France as much as they do in India. For example, people aged between 30 and 35 in France have similiar figures to kids aged between 0 and 5. On the other hand, in India children this age are around double that of the adults between 30 and 35. Another importnat difference is that the diagram provides detailed information about the age structure of the population in India only up to 70 years of age, compared to France's which extends to 85.
It must be noted that in France gender distribution is close to equal for younger people but after 60 years of age females outnumber males greatly, however in India no such trend is noticable."
"In some countries it is a common practice for people to track down their bloodline's history. People give different motivations as to why they do it. I suppport this activity for reasons I will further explain in this essay.
To begin with, some people want to get information about their family's history just of pure interest. It can be a great hobby for someone to invest their time and enegry into. It will help one destress and have some fun, while also enrichening his area of knowledege. In addition to having something entertaining do to in their free time, one will learn a lot about what his family has been thorugh long before he was born. This is really important because without our anscestors we would not have been born or in other words - without the past there would be no future. If one respects his family and himself enough, he should learn about who they were and where they came from.
Furthermore, learning about one's family history can be very benefitial in finding your talents. For instance, if someone finds out that in the family there once was someone who was great footballer, then this is something one should try out. Geneticaly, some people are born with specific talents, predisposing them to pursuit a ceratin career path. Being aware of your family's past can be a great hint towards your strenghts and weaknesses.
In conclusion, finding out your family's history is not only a fun hobby that you can do in your spare time, it can also assist you in finding your talents in life without having to always try out new activities."
"The chart draws a comparision between age groups of the inhabitants of France and India in the year 1984.
Overall, just by taking a glance at the chart we can see that the people living in France tend to have a longer lifespan as compared to people living in India, this may be because of better standards of living that are available to French citizens.
The graph representing the Indian population is linear and decreases gradually, with the exception being the senior citizens over the age of 70, while on the other hand, the graph depicting the French citizens is varied, for instance, the graph states that are more people under the age group of 30-35 as compared to 25-30, a similar pattern can be observed when we look at the people under the age group 50-55 versus people under the age group of 45-50. Another immidiate take away is that there are more senior citizens in France compared to India out of which the majority are females, that too by a substantial amount."
"The world was a completely different place a century ago and it is a common belief that our ancestors had to face many hardships in order to provide their future generations with a comfortable and fulfilling lifestyle. Therefore, some people across the world try to research their own family's history in order to appreciate their efforts, this may be out of curiosity. This essay argues that one should not put out their inquisitiveness and should try to learn more about how their family really came to be.
Inquiring about one's predecessors should be persured as learning more about your own family can never be harmful, infact, doing so will only make one more appreciative towards their family and its history. Like, if it is revealed that one's family had made many sacrifices in order to preserve their bloodline and nuture it to what it is today then it would make the current family members thankful for what they have and where they stand.
Having knowledge about one's own family tree is one of the ways to make a person humble and appreciative for what they have, it also teaches a person to work hard for their own family in the future in order to provide them with a good and healthy life. Nowadays, majority of the families have cultures and customs exclusive to their own family and by studying their ancestors, the true significance of these activities can be discorvered, taught and passed down to the future generations.
To summarize, this essay believes that there really are no negatives in learning about one's own family tree, in fact, there are many positives in doing so. Asking parents to talk about their own families is a good way to build healty relationships and the knowlege gained can be passed down to future generations and the familty ehnicity can be preserved and cherished for many more decades."
"The bar charts presented illustrate the division of age groups in two countries, India and France, in 1984. The charts are divided by age group and gender. Overall, it is possible to noticed that both countries had a roughly equal division for the population percentage between males and females in all ages.
While India's largest population in the given year was composed by children aged 0-5, France largest population rate was adults aged 30-35. People between the ages of 60-65 represented India's lowest percentage at about 1% for both women and men. Males that were more than 85 years old were the ones with the lowest proportion in France (less than 1%).
When analysing India's population, we note that there was a tendency of shortage in the percentage of the population, both for male and female, as the age incresed. The only exeption of this trend are people aged 70 or more, that had slightly higher rate than the previous age (65-70).
Regarding France's population, the percentage rate fluctuated between all ages, the lowest being for men aged 85 or more (less than 1%) and the highest for females between ages 30 and 35 (4%)."
"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.
Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.
To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life."

"The process diagram illustrates the procedure of making woolen goods. And the total procedure can be mainly divided into 4 stages respectively.
We can see immediately that the whole procedure of woolen goods making is outrageously complicated. Initially, the fur is sheared from a white sheep by a worker and sent to the stages of cleaning and drying. Subsequently, the dried fur is sent to a spinning machine where the fur is not only spun into some wool but also some string while the string is going to be recycled. In the following stage, the wool is made into tufts of wool and stored together to become the tuft storage. Eventually, after workers knitting balls of yarn from the tuft storage into various woollen goods, the making of woolen products such as carpets and jackets have been completed.
In conclusion, the making and the process of making woolen goods is complicated."
"The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.
Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.
However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.
In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure."
"This picture shows the process of making different stuff from the wool. There are several steps which are included in the way of the production of woolen goods and there are two deciding points, one in the middle and another one at the end.
As a first step we have to shave a wool of a sheep and after that the wool has to be cleaned. When the wool is free of dirt there comes the process of drying, during which the water will be vapored out of the wool. Dried wool has to underwent spinning process from which we will receive a wool and a string. The string is recycled and from the wool, the tufts will be made. Many tufts can go through coloring process and after that, they are transported to the storage. The storage consists of many different balls of yarn and as a final step we can decide if we want to use it for knitting or if it will go to some manufacture where carpets or jackets are made."
"Many people believe that money is the main reason why employees want to remain in the same workplace for a long time, even there could be many other reasons why to stay. It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.
The reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.
On the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.
In conclusion, I mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but I would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are."
"The figure indicates the process of the production of woolen items. There are a total of about 13 steps where raising sheep is an initial step and woolen products such as carpets and jackets are the final step.
To put into detail, growing up sheep is the starting process to obtain enough amount of wool. Thereafter, the fur covering the sheep is completely shaved, which is followed by cleaning and drying. Besides, dried wool is sent onto the spinning step, which creates wool. The spinning process also produces string, which is mainly reused. Tufts of wool which is made by crossing wools are delivered into tuft storage. A tuft of wool which is picked up is formed into a round shape, which is called balls of yarn. Finally, Balls of yarn are extracted into carpets or jackets. This is also used for knitting among some people."
"With the development of society, it goes without saying that more people come to prior their carrier to their own private life. Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.
To begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.
Some augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.
Having considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business. There must be other vital factors present such as social statius and rewarding/"
"The diagram below depicts several steps in producing the woolen goods.
Overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.
In order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.
After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.
The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life."
"There are some aspects that people usually consider when they want to decide whether they will stay in their current workforce or not. Partly, I agree that money is the most important factor which makes people stay in their job.
The reason is because we work in order to be able to purchase our daily needs. It's undeniably true that we need money to sustain our daily life. We have to use our money to pay our bills such as foods, electricity, debt and other basic needs. Furthermore, we know that the number of the number of inflation keeps increasing this year due to the unstabilty of the economic circumstance which results in the increament of goods prices. Having said that, money becomes very essential reason to stay in the company because it really helps us to afford a better life.
However, in my opinion, there is another important aspect that we should consider when we are in middle of deciding whether to stay in the company or not. The important aspect is the working environment. Aside from money, we have to make sure that we can improve our skills in the current employment. By having a positive and supportive working environment, we will be able to maximize all of our capabilities which can make us a better person professionally.
In conclusion, I agree that money becomes one of the most important factor that we should consider in choosing our job as we need money to afford a good life. On the other side, becoming a better person and feeling fulfilled by our job also requires other important aspect other than money which is a healthy working environment."
"The following chart illustrates the percentages of people born inside and outside Australia during the time gape of 1995 and 2010
Generally, it seems that people born in cities inside and outside Australia get the highest rate compared to towns and rural areas inside and outside Australia
Getting more into details, it can be observed that people born in cities wether outside or inside australia only increased. In contrast, in 1995, people born in australia in towns decreased compared to 2010, and that can also be seen in people born in rural areas. While people born in rural areas in 1995 outside Australia had bigger difference that inside Australia, that changed in 2010, because it drastically decreased, getting lower than those born in rural towns inside Australia.
In addition, people born in towns inside and outside Australia nearly maintained that same difference, though they both decreased in the time between 1995 and 2010."
"The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.
Manufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.
Customers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.
Personally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging."
"The percentage of people, living in urban, rural or city areas has been illustrated in this bar chart. These charts shows the amount of foreigners and nationals living in these areas from 1995 to 2010.
Overall, the charts shows that the percentage of all people living in Australia prefer to live in cities in 2010. Both national citizens and foreigners are more keen on living in cities as opposed to rural or suburban areas.
The people born in Australia experienced a steady decline in percentage of people living in suburban and rural areas between 1995 to 2010. The amount of people living in the city increased from 50% to over 60%
The prefered living situation among foreigners fluctuated a bit between 1995 to 2010. Herein 40% of people born outside of Australia lived in rural areas in 1995. This amount decreased to approximately 5% in 2010. The amount of foreigners living in cities skyrocketed from 60% in 1995 to 80% in 2010.
In conclusion, the bar charts show an overall progression of both foreign and national citizens now living in cities as opposed to rural or suburban areas."
"The use of products and goods with a lot of packaging is a highly controversial topic between people today. A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging. I personally believe that it is the individuals responsibility to cease buying products with an increased amount of packaging, since a decrease in demand from customers could prevent further production of these goods.
The people that is of the opinion that it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging, believe that these companies have a moral obligation to preserve and protect the environment. In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.
However, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.
To summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm. However, I believe that it is the individuals responisibility to not purchase overly packaged products, since this decrease in demand would lead to less production of these goods."
"The bar charts illustrate the proportions of Australian citizens living in three different types of areas which are divided into two groups, namely the people born in and outside Australia. The figures are given for 1995 and 2010.s
Roughly speaking, no matter where the people were born, it is noticeable that the majority of Australians lived in cities. This trend experienced a considerable increase from 1995 to 2010, while in the other two alternative places of living, towns and rural areas, there were overall fewer people choosing to live in 2010 than in 1995.
Looking at the people living in cities first, around 50 percent of people who were born in Australia lived in cities in 1995, but this figure rose to over 60 percent in 2010. At the same time, 60 percent of those who were born outside of Australia decided to live in cities in 1995, and this proportion increased to 80 percent fifteen years later.
With regard to the people living in rural areas, the proportion of people fell dramatically from 1995 to 2010 despite where they were born, especially for the people born outside of Australia. The percentage reduced to approximately one-eighth in 2010 compared to 1995. By contrast, the changes in the proportions of people living in towns from 1995 to 2010 seem to be marginal, according to the charts. While five percent fewer of the people born in Australia lived in towns in 2010 than in 1995, the proportions of the people who were born outside of Australia and lived in towns in both mentioned years remained almost stable."
"Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both."

"The represented bar chart stipulates the information about the proportion of citizens were born outside and inside Australia staying in three given distictive areas.
As a whole, over the 15-year period given almost of inhabitants tended to live in urban areas. Moreover, people born in Australia and outside Australia that moved from towns and rural zones to cities increasingly after 15 years.
Looking at the groups of citizen who matured in Autralia in more details, we can notably discern that inhabitants stayed in cities rocketed, which started around 50% in 1995 to more than 60% in 2010. Additionally, the opposite trend is true for the two remaining groups; the figure of town and rural citizens declined approximately a half to hit a same low point at about 10% after 15-year period.
Turning to the groups of people who were not born in Australia, it is manifestly perceived that the percentage of urban inhabitants was 60% in 1995, then reached a peak of 80% in 2010. There were noticeable decreasing in town and rural population, began at about 12% and 405 in 1995 to 10% and 5% in the last year period, respectively."
"It is oft remarked that in recent times, only customers have the responsibility to avoid cosuming products with various wrappings; nonetheless, I only partly consent to this statement. Hence, this fact-based essay will examine both perspectives of this phenomenon and proffer my concluding opinion.
There is a plethora of underlying rationales for why producers and marketers should control the overusing of packaging. To begin with, it appears to be undeniable that they should applied recycle materials to contain foods and drinks, which can reused to cover beverages again. Perhaps one of the most self-evident and much-discussed examples of this can be observed when beer bottles are usually collected and brought to plans in order to remake and sell a second time. And what is more, another salient point frequently made is that they should find out the best way to simplify the wrapping process to consumed fewer bags, which still perfectly protect products.
When viewed from a distinctive angle; notwithstanding, I also concede that consumers also have the function to reduce the using of packages. First and foremost, citizens can bring their own bags while shopping to avoid taking numerous nilon bags which offered by sellers. For instance, they can bring hanmade bags, paper boxes or recycle packages to buy foods comfortably. Apart from the above-mentioned pivotal point, it may not be untrue to assert that customers should also read about the disadvantages of garbage overload to boost their awareness about using packages suitably to protect our natural environment. This is not to say that this is the only way to take into account of this topic.
Taken as a whole, it seems to me that both producers and consumers have the prominent tasks to control the consuming of pakages to save our life."

"The bar chart respectively illustrates the percentage of Australian people who were living in urban, rural and town among those who were born in and outside this country in 1995 and 2010.
In general, in these two years, the proportion of people living in cities had an increase, no matter where they were born. In contrast, the proportion of people living in other two places both had a decrease.
At the beginning, the figure of the percentage of city citizens all had a significant increase. For those who were borned in Australia, its number grew from about 50% in 1995 to over 60% in 2010, while for those who were borned outside Australia, there was a 20% increase. Meanwhile, in any given year, the percentage of people who were borned abroad lived in cities was higher.
Secondly, for those who lived in town, its proportion went down no matter in which year and where peple were borned. But for thoes who lived in rural areas, it is totally different. Although for those had the same birth place, its proportion also went down, the percentage of people who were borned abroad lived in rural areas is higher than that of those who were borned in this country in 1995, yet it is opposite in 2010."
"Opnions are divided on whether manufacturers and supermarkets should reduce the numbers of packaging of products, or consumers should not buy over-packaging goods. From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.
On the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.
On the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.
In conclusion, even though customers can help to solve this case, I believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over-packaged goods, becasue if all sellers are competiting on it, customers will have no choices."
"The table indicates the proportion of adults in the countryside and city areas who took part in four free-time activities and comparisons between 1990 and 2010. Overall, there are two activities, reading, and photography increased the time in both areas, whereas the other two activities, animated play, and playing can be seen as a reduction in the urban area or rural area in 2010.
To go into detail, reading was the predominantly longest time in 1990 and 2010 and increased in both areas. The time was 61, and 71, in the urban and rural areas in 1990. In addition, the time increased to 78, and 78 in both areas in 2010. Furthermore, in terms of photography, the time used to be 7, and 14, in the urban and rural areas in 1990, whereas the time soared to 17, and 24 in the urban and rural areas respectively in 2010.
When it comes to animated play, although the time in the urban area remained the same time, a slight reduction can be seen in the rural area in 2010. The time in the urban area was 10 in 1990 and 2010. But the time in the rural area dropped from 18 to 14 between 1990 and 2010. Playing can be seen an opposite phenomenon, compared with animated play. The time in the urban area was 21, and 26 in the rural area in 1990. In contrast, the time in the urban area diminished to 14, whereas the time in the rural area leveled off. It was the same 26 in the rural area."
"In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.
To begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.
On the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should
not diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.
Finally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.
In conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future."
"The table compares the propotions of urban and rural residents who enjoyed the four leisure time activities in 1990 and 2010.
Overall, it is clear that both two groups would like to do some reading in both 1990 and 2010. However, in 1990, photography was the least popular activity for both urban and rural adults, while in 2010, the difference went to the animated play.
In 1990, 61% of urban people and 71% of rural people would more likely to take part in the reading activity, which was the most popular act compared to other activities. In the same year, playing took the second place, with 21% of urban people and 26% of rural people participating in respectively. At the same time, 10% of urban people and 18% of rural people choose animated play. However, photography was the least popular activity, with only 7% of urban people and 14% of rural people taking part in respectively.
By 2010, read still took the first place compared to other three activities, which had increased to 78% of people in both groups. Interestingly, photography took the escond place, with 17% of urban people and 24% of rural people participating in respectively. At the same period, 14% of urban people and 26% of rural people choose playing. Finally, animated play became the least popular activity, with a small fraction of 10% of urban people and 14% of rural people taking part in respectively."
"Nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. Some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.
Firstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. If those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
In addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.
In conclusion, I agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media , which can largely reduce crimes. Moreover, we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes."
"The table compares different percentage of people from urban and rural areas who took part in four free time activities between 1990 and 2010.
Overall, people from the two areas were more likely to do reading both in 1990 and 2010. Meanwhile, in 1990, reading and playing were the two highest activites for them. On the contrary, reading and playing photograph had become more popular in 2010.
By 1990, we can see clearly that 61% and 71% of people were like to do some reading in urban and rural areas respectively, which took the highest rate to other three activities. However, playing photograph seemed not so much popular in both areas, with only 7% and 14% of adults respectively.
Turn to 2010, things had a llittle change in the percentage of playing photograph which became the second highest rate among people's four different activities, with 17% and 24% of people respectively. Of course, reading also take the first place of the whole activities, with the same rate of 78% in"
"Nowadays, more and more news of crimes and other kinds of violent events were explosed. Some people think it is not good to report them on television and in newspapers beacuse it can have adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, we should not restrict this information because of the following reasons.
At first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes. If the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. Thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
Secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes. Take it into more detaily, If people cannot directly obtain the criminal informations, they maybe cannot analysis the the broad of law, thus easily drop into crimes. When they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it. At last, leading a severe consquences which have adverse impact on both social and personal fields.
In conclusion, i agree more with this opinion that we should explose the crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers, which can stop the crimes or decrease the rate of crimes."
"The bar chart illustrates the four free time activities (Reading, Animated play, playing and Photography) that were joined by adults in urban and rural areas in the year 1990 and 2010.
Overall, Reading has the highest percentage for both years whether in Rural or Urban area. Meanwhile Photography has the lowest percentage in 1990 and Animated play in 2010.
In 1990, Rural areas had a higher percentage of adults participated in free time activities. Reading was the highest of them all which has 71 percent compared to 61% in Urban areas. All 4 activities in Rural areas are higher by 5 to 10 percent than in Urban areas.
In 2010, there was no difference in percentage in Reading between Rural and Urban areas which is 78%. However, in Playing and Photography there were a slighlty a big difference ( 12% and 7% respectively) The lowest difference was Animated play which is 4%."
"There are a lot of negative effects in reporting crimes and violent news in different media outlets such as the television and reading material such as newspaper. This type of information should be banned from being televised or printed in the media.
In my opinion, It is more beneficial to the public to know what is happening around us so I disagree with the statememt above.
Nowadays, you can access different news outlet through television or using your phone as long as you are connected to the internet. Reading or watching the news are more and more accessible to the public. By merely, clicking the link we are able to read or watch the latest news in our area.
There are a lot of crimes happening in the world, it may have a negative consequence but I think it will outweigh the information that we will learn by reading or watching the news. We will able to know what is happening in our area and how to prevent such crimes.
In our area, according to KOMO news there are a lot of thieves lurking around 12 midnight to 4 am. They are usually walking house to house to check the porch if they can steal something. Some thieves check cars if someone forgot to lock it. This gives them opportunity to steal it.
By watching the news, this will alert the public to be on the look out and prevent the thieves from stealing valuable items from us. We can also find ways to be more safe. We can install cameras with motion censors around our house that will notify us if there are people walking around our property.
In conclusion, I disagree in restricting the report on various crimes and violent news to the public through television and newspapers because"
"The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.
First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.
On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.
On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.
To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing."
"During the dinner, most of families like to watch news on television or read newspapers. Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.
First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
On the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.
As far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent. They need also to be protect from mental health problems, and so we need to explain that they watch and these images."
"The table shows what adults in urban and rural areas alocated their free time in 1990 and 2010. Orveall, we can see that the time allocation didn't change a lot, except for reading that had a relevant increase for urban adults and for phorography activities, and for prography, that represents another relevant increase for urban and rural.
We can see more difference for urban adults than for rural. Reading time becoming almost 30% higher for urban adults in 2010. Animated play didn't have any significant modication. Playing just represents a decrease for urban adults and keep the same target for rural.
In other hand, protography almost represents the twice in a increase for both, urban and rural adults. Regarding to this table, it is possible saw that rural habbits for a free time activies didn't change a lot, and in a urban aspect just reading and photography represents a relevant modification."
"Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.
This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.
I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.
For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.
In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.
I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves."

"The table summarizes the proportion of adult people, coming both from cities or countryside, involved in four different kinds of leisure activities in 1990 and 2010.
Overall, the most popular activity throughout the analysed period is reading. Furthermore, reading and photography gained popularity over time, whereas the other two reimained stable or witnessed a downward trend.
With regard to upward trend activities, reading increased from 61% to 78% in urban people, while the increase is smaller, from 71 to 78% in countryside inhabitants. In addiction, popularity of photography soared both in cities rural areas, with a rise from 7% to 17% and 14% to 24%, respectively.
Turning to the other activities, animated play witnessed a slight fall in prevalence from 18% to 14% among rural people, while it remained stable at 10% in the cities. Furthermore, a pledge by 7% of playing was reported in urban inhabitants, starting at 21% and arriving at 14% ten years later. However, no changes were found in the prevalence of playing in the countryside, who remained stable at 26%."
"Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.
The mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.
Another reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.
In conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence. This aim may be pursued by public authorities, through the promulgation of new laws and rules."
"The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.
In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.
In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools."
"Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.
The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.
Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.
In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life."
"The given bar charts display the number of hours each teacher spent education in different schools in four different countries in 2001. Overall, it is clear that the USA spent much higher hours in lower secondary and upper secondary school than the three countries, whereas there are no significant differences in the number of hours in primary school in the four countries.
Initially, the USA spent much higher hours in lower secondary school and upper secondary school. Specifically, it was aroud 1000, and nearly 1200 hours respectively. The second highest country which spent in upper secondary school was 900, Iceland(almost the same as Spain). There are three hundred gaps. In addition, there is a huge gap in the number of hours in lower secondary school between the USA and Spain. Spain had around eight hundred hours and it also have approximately two hundred gaps between the USA and Spain.
Interestingly, it can be seen that there are the lowest gaps in hours from primary school to upper secondary school in Japan. It is the lowest hours teachers spent hours in upper secondary school. Specifically, it was 600 in primary shool, 650 hours in lower secondary shool, and around seven hundred hours respectively."
"Some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
Cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
Recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
Finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems."
"The bar chart illustrates the man-hours in the pedagogical work in 2001 across Japan, USA, Iceland, and Spain. The results of the survey were taken from primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools.
The primary schools are the easiest to work on with each country, Japanese teachers spend exactly 600 hours, while in Iceland the overall time is marginally less. Spain and USA are at the level of dedication with about 620 hours.
The lower secondary schools pay more attention to education. However, the increase in hours is slight in Japan and Iceland by about 10 to 20 hours. Spaniards take this type of school a bit more seriously, whereas Americans put extra effort to tutor for more than 900 hours.
The upper secondary education is universally the most intense. Japanese rise their hours by small margin as usual, while Spanish and Icelandic people almost reach 920 hour mark. In United States, the effort is taken to a whole new level with teacher working whopping 1100 hours."
"Most vehicles release a toxic amount of fumes into the atmosphere. This, in turn, has grown into an environmental issue of global concern that governments across the world believe can be mitigated by adding on to the price of fuels. I chiefly disagree with the effectiveness of this method as next to nothing had been altered since the policy enforcement due to convenience issues.
The number of cars utilizing fuel has not dwindled. Even though many alternatives had been suggested, there was no mass production of transportation units for the use of average salary workers. The middle crust of society does not possess sufficient income to shift to environmentally friendly solutions for the fear of maintenance hardships. For instance, an electrical car would necessitate a spacious charging spot in front of a garage that not many possess. As a consequence, the more convenient and trustworthy solution to buy fuel is resorted to.
The population of the world as a whole does not stay in one place. As more and more people are born, there is a growing need for transport to be manufactured in a short span of time. Although a part of the population may be able to abandon their cars in exchange for bikes or buses, a significant portion of the growing society still opts for refueling cars in gas stations to get to places faster.
In conclusion, while the idea of the price policy introduction bore few fruits, they had not been enough to make a contribution to solving the carbon footprint. Ironically, people would rather overspend for their comfort than think about nature."

"The bar below illustrates the number of hours a single teacher spent doing their job in four distinct schools in four different countries in year 2001.
to highlight the main features, it is noticeable that U.S.A has the highest number of hours of all the four different countries in the upper secondary and the lower secondary schools.
to be more precise, iceland and spain has almost an equivalent 900 hours in the uppper secondary school. To compare, japan and spain are approximantly the same in primary school with almost 50 hours difference for spain. However, looking at the lower secondary school there is a huge diffrence when it comes to upper secondary school and spain has the upper hand in this score.
to summrize the above, teachers has given more hours in the upper secondary school in all unique countries. Seemingly due to the easier communication with older and more mature students. On the other side, teachers has given less hours in primary school."
"Some individuals believe that one of the best solutions for environmental issues is to increase the fuel prices for cars and
other vehicles.
generally, increasing the cost of gas or fuel would decrease the amount of people utilising environment detriment vehicles. Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.
In my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.
To strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.
to summarize, increasing the gas prices without spreading awarness among youngsters equivalently would not be a convenient action. To confirm, extreme low gas prices could lead to another consequence that is traffic which creates a suffocating atmosphere that will surely kill wild animals and people as well as the years go by."
"The population from all countries have diferent age groups. This age groups are influence by diferent factors and thou variates from year to year changing the country compossition.
The population of New Zeland in the year 2011 had 4.400.000 of total population from all ages. The table shows 4 diferent age groups: under 15, 15-39, 40-64 and plus 65. The group with the major percentege in this year was 15-39 followed by 40-64, under 15 and last plus 65.
The next year(2012) the percenteges in every group change. The total population in 2012 was 4.460.000 with a 0,6 growth. Under 15 and 15-39 decrease in 0,2 percent; 40-64 and plus 65 increase by 0,6 and 4,0 percent. We can crearly see that in year of 2012 the young ages decreased and the older ages increases"
"Listening to music is a very relaxing excercise, for some people more that other. In my opinion, reducing people stress is music most important function. Weather playing music or listening to it, are both relaxing activities.
Listening to music is very relaxing and it will help you reduce stress. One can listen to music at home or while doing outdoor activities like running or going to the gym. Listening to music after a long working day is a greate practice that will help you decrease stress. There are diferent types of music, some are belived to be more relaxing than others like classical music compare to rock and roll. Scientists have demostrated by several investigations that music helps people reduce stress, after listening to music people feel more calm and have more clear thoughts.
Some people think that music most important function is not reducing stress , instead they found it superficial and distracting. They think other activities are better at reducing stress like yoga or playing sports. Not all people feel relax by listening to music, some may find it unconfortable or unnecessary.
To summarise music most important function is that helps people reduce stress. Music as a tool for reducing stress can be used by listening to it at the end of your day or during it, this will help you overcome your weekly rutine. Classical music is recomended over several styles of music to be the more relaxing one. Listening to music can help you take better decisions and overcome dificult situations that could present in your daily rutine."
"The present table provides data on the fluctuation of New Zealand's population between 2011 and 2012, divided by age groups.
An upward overall trend can be observed if all age groups are taken into account, as the population had grown by 0.6% by the year 2012.
However, the number of children, teens, and young adults - 0-39 years - slightly dropped during this time, respectively by 0.2%, while the middle-aged group mildly increased. The greatest elevation occurred in the oldest age group, 65-year-olds and above: their numbers had risen by 4% over the year.
As for the specific numbers, in 2011, the population of New Zealand counted 4.400.000 people, while it almost reached 4.5 million people in the next year. Under 15, there were roughly 801.000 individuals, which plummeted by nearly 2.000 in 2012. The most significant increase can be observed amongst the 65+ age group since individuals belonging here reached 900.000, compared to 500.000 in the previous year."
"In most people's life, music takes a special place. No matter if one's favourite is classical, pop, rock, or rap, it can help people distract their attention from unwanted thoughts, alleviate stress, or even reduce pain. My strong belief is that music has a significant psychological effect in maintaining mental health, and some of its most vital impacts are visible on mood and stress.
Music can induce extremely strong changes in people's mental states. There are several everyday examples that highlight the tranquillizing effect of music. Many people find out merely by instinct that they tend to calm down by listening to their favourite tunes. When someone feels anxious before an important exam, a medical visit, or a long-awaited date, music can provide a couple of minutes escape from these stressful situations, on our way to the event's venue. Soft music is also frequently utilized during meditative activities, such as yoga or relaxation. Additionally, people can come across the same type of calming tunes in dental or medical settings as well. However, these are quite passive coping techniques.
On the other hand, there are more active possible mechanisms by which music can reduce stress. When dancing or working out to upbeat music, people decrease their stress levels through movement. It can be an even more efficient way to let the harmful energies behind because of a two-way effect: music tends the soul, while the movement is good for the body, reducing tension in the muscles.
In summary, based on the above-reviewed examples of how music can be helpful in stress-relief, we can see that there is two possible mechanism, a passive and an active, which can play a role in this phenomenon."
"MY OWN QUESTION FOR TASK 1: https://ieltstrainingonline.com/ielts-writing-recent-actual-test-69/
The maps show modifications to the ground floor of an art gallery from 2005 to the present day.
Overall, the floor underexperienced a transformation with various facilities being relocated, replaced or added.
During the period from 2005 till now, the reception desk was repositioned closer to the center of the floor. The corridor was further widened to the left-hand side of the ground floor, taking up the space of the former gallery office. There is now an elevator contigous to the stairs, and the café on the top left corner of the ground floor was converted into a gallery shop with a vending machine just outside.
A major change to the area is that the exhibition room 4 has been divided into two smaller rooms for the purposes of temporarily exhibiting items and children playing. Meanwhile, the three exhibition rooms on the right-hand side remain unchanged. Another change made to the ground floor is the addition of ramp for wheelchairs right next to the entrance."
"MY OWN QUESTION FOR TASK 2: People living in the twenty-first century have a better quality of life than
people who live in previous centuries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
In this modern age, some believe that people’s quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.
To begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.
The standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.
In conclusion, I believe that people living in the 21st century have a better quality life than the past."
"This table depicts the demographic population of New Zealand from 2011 to 2012, dividing people into four age groups: under 15, 15-39, 40-64, and people 65 or older.
Overall, there are unconsequential percentage changes in a year among people of all ages, whilst the number of people who were 65 or above grew more dramatically than other groups.
The population of New Zealand elevated by about 0.6%, from 4.4 million in 2011 to 4.6 million in 2012. Similar changes have been indicated among people aged 40-64. However, the percentage change of children under 15 declined to about 0.2%, from 802 thousand in 2011 to 800 thousand in 2012.
The majority of the population consisted of an adult group of people 15-39, which changes into 10 years were similar to children's groups, 0.2% escalated, in 2011 they were just more than 1.5 million, however, showed a declining trend in 2012 with 1.5 people."
"In general, music plays a vital role in our everyday work life. It is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.
Music addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. Without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.
This makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. For example, I am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. As a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. In addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. Such as listening to the verses of the Quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.
Furthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. People who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. Nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.
To conclude, I think that the most important function of music is to explain life, its beauty, meaning, and feeling. And indeed in relaxing one's mind."
"The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from
2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.
Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.
In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.
As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012."
"Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.
On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.
On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.
In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits."

"The diagram shows a demonstration of how essential oil is used in a perfumery manufacturing system to produce perfume.
Overall, the given process consists of ten stages in the perfume production process, starting with the boiling of water and ending with the refined hydrolat.
The production process of perfume begins with a water container being placed over a heat source using fire. The bubbling water then evaporates releasing hot steam which flows to the second container through a tube.
At this point, the steam is used to increase the temperature of aromatic plants, letting the raw materials produce oil to trap the mixture of steam and oil vapor.
Following this, the production process continues the vaporized oil flows through a coiling system the condenser where it's condensed.
Simultaneously, both ends of the cell contain hot and cold water supplied by two different tubes. In the last step, water mixed with essential oil is then shifted to the separator where it’s filtered out to produce the final product hydrolat."
"People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words.
There are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.
Furthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.
I believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.
Secondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.
One evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.
In conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages. I believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it's an office or business-related work then they should use formal words in written language."
"The diagram below shows the process of creating perfume.
The given illustration gives us an opportunity to understand that there is one main pipe. The first part of this pipe has hot water. This hot water pumps via plants then cools down in the second part of the pipe, mixed with oil and as a result it will be an aromatic oil.
The source of aroma is aromatic plants, it is the main ingredient. We use steam to get aroma from plants. If we want to get steam, we should use a strong fire. Flame will boil water in the tank.
Using cold water will help to quickly refrigerate hot water in a condenser. This cold water after the previous stage will be entered into the vessel which is called a separator. Separator is the place where cold aroma water is mixed with essential oil. Finally, the bottom side of mixed water will become a hydrolat - the final result of the process."
"It is noticeable that when we write something we try to use more informal language. Moreover the written text is more redundant, cohesive, calm and patient. From my point of view, it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice. Not only voice influence on it, but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text. Moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, there is a huge advantage of this cartain. When we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly. For instance, I sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if I write to him or her.
On the other hand, there is a disadvantage, that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences. For example, during my work, I communicate via messages more than via calling. Sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that I was rude and insult them.
Finally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. This fact has a lot of cons and pros. I think that cons dominate under pros. What is more, it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results. Neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea."
"The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.
For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.
Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry."
"Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.
Hence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.
On the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.
On the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.
In conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient. Albeit, there are also clear disadvantages, for instance, the misinterpretation of the context."
"The oil plays a significant role in such a process in producing the perfumes. As it is charted out, the oil participates in around 50% of the process, starting from step 4 to step 9.
The process begins in steps 1, 2 and 3 with heating water till evaporation, so steam forms. This steam then flows through the aromatic plants gathering oil in form of vapor in step 4. Within the 5th step, the vaporized oil along with the preformed steam migrate together and move to the cooling step. In the condenser, 3 different steps cooperate for the process to continue. From step 6, cold water joins the system to help in the condensation process of both the steam and the oil vapor. In the 7th step, the heated water through cooling of the flowen mixture escapes out of the process. Both steps together, promotes reaching step 8, in which the water mixed with essential oil is formed.
Within the separator, the essential oil is derived from the preformed mixture and this allocates in step 10 the aromatic water and accordingly in step 9 the essential oil."
"Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.
Using a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.
On the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.
To summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way."
"The diagram illustrates the process of using oil in perfume production.
It is possible to highlight four main steps of the process according to the different test tubes that are used. The first step consists of boiling water. It happens without oil. As a main result of this step we can set a steam that will be used in the production in future. On the second step oil takes part for the first time. It mixes with steam, that was mentioned before, after its way through the aromatic plants. The substance that appears after the second step plays the main role in the production. It will be modified to get the perfume.
On the third step the substance is tempered with hot and cold water in condenser. Then reached essential oil is suitable to be mixed with water in separator. As a result of this process hydrolat (aromatic water) can be gotten. Thus, oil has an essential role in process of production of perfume."
"Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.
The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.
On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.
In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay."

"The graph displays information about the count of a community website users during the first and second year after the launch. Overall, the number of users appeared to be higher in the second year among all months.
In more detail, in September of the first year, which considered the first month after the launch, the number of users was relatively low with around 1,000 users, then a significant increases in the numbers has been seen in October and November to make up 5,000 and 10,000 users, respectively. During December, the users count remained still to be followed by a dramatic drop reaching around 2,500 users in January. February witnessed the lowest point of both years, then followed by multiple increases to reach its highest point of the first year which is in August with exactly 15,000 users.
While during the second year, September was the lowest point accounting for approximately 2,500 users, follwed by a fast increase in October to hit almost the double. A sharp increase was noticed in November and December to make up almost 17,500, followed by a slight drop in February and March with exactly 10,000 users. Multiple increases were noticed in the months April, May, June, and July to reach around 12,500, 20,000, 22,500, and 22,500, respectively. August faced another drawback to reach the same count as April."
"Food crisis might be considered as one of the most worrying matters among the globe. Despite the fact that poverty ratios are constantely increasing, tonnes of foods were thrown away every year. I believe that uncountable reasons could be behind this awful phenomenon, and many solutions should be taken to reduce the amounts of these wasted foods and to reduce the starvation. I will mention some in this essay.
Starting from the root causes, cooking a feast for a small group of people might be considered part of any country's culture such as many countries in the golf area, or otherwise, the person would look as stingy or even a bad host. Although some people order a huge amount of food just for the purpose of bragging, sometimes it could be due to wrong estimation of the number of guests or the portion that is needed for each individual.
Nevertheless, such matter should have immediate solutions, on both personal and global level. Governments should take all actions needed to increase the awareness of the danger of this problem and its negative consequences, whether through social media platforms or through the national TV, and to find innovative ways to hold their citizens responsible for minimising such cruical issue. Moreover, individuals should always make sure to donate the extra food to any person that is in need.
In conclusion, wasting food has been a significant issue since very long time ago. There are many reasons for this unpleasant habit, whether due to cultural impact or personal attitude; therefore, fast actions must be taken from both individuals and governments."
"The bar chart compares the number of visitors to a community website in the first two years of use.
It is noticeable that the website attracted more visitors in the second years of use. Also, the number of users dropped both years from Dcember to Febuary.
Specifically, more people visited the website in the second year, except for August, during which the website was visited more in the first year. Among all the months listed, the biggest gap took place in May, with roughly 20000 people browsed the website in the second year, which was about 12500 more than the figure for the first year. Over the period, the amont of visitors in the second year was 10000 more than that of the first year, whereas as in Augusr, September and October, the interval dropped to less than 1000.
The figure saw an increase in both years from September to November, and then dropped in the following months. In the first year, the number of visitors rose from roughly 1000 in September to 10000 in November, and then dropped to less than 1000 in Feburary. It was the same story in the second year, with the figure peaked to roughly 18000 in November and plummeted to 10000 in Feburary. In both years, the figure witnessed an increase for the rest of the period, with the highest figure of 23000 in the second year"
"In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly."
"The line chart describes data about the two years of how many visitors to the community website let us discuss the differences between the first year and the next year.
We can clearly see the changes between the two years, so in October the people who visit were around 5000 which is nearly the same in the first and second year unlike in September all of them were less than 5000, after that in November, also December we can see the massive change at the next year the was the number of both lines amidst 15000 and 20000, while the first year also the two line where the same but less then the next year, it obvious that the blue line decline at the next three months, also the red line but not in mammouth way.
In April.
As it is persented In April the all the lines are start to increase but the red line is highest then the blue line however, in May the visitors were 20000 unlike the first year they were less then 10000, but in June it grow to more than 10000 and on other hand the red line increase to more than 20000 , also the next month there were no huge changes, moving to the last month both of line decrease to around 15000.
Overall, it is clear that the second year the humans who visited the website where more in all the months ulike the last month the where almost the same and the first year was a little but higher."
"one of the important issues of a lot of massive places on the earth is the mammoth food that is wasted let is discuss more about why and what we can figure out to less this problem.
Firstly, there is many reasons, like the big celebrations which are something popular that happen a lot, also we can see that now adays restrants being almost every where so people these days like to go there always than before, and the most famous things is the junk food which is so cheap consequently more visitors that looking for a fast things because they are busy, while others who buy more than they need because they are hungry.
Secondly, we can help that issues by many ways, first is by knowing your calories; you will eat just what you need, also do not spend much of money in reasrant because it makes you dreadful by let your body ask for more fast food however, it is curcial to only buy the stuff you really needed only and cook in your home, moving to the huge events it is significant to make sure of how many people who will come so you breing foods as the needed, and when we want to buy foods we must think if it will be sasted or not and ask ourselves if it is significant.
At the end, this is a important proplem that we should take car of and start to solve it and let more humans know about this problem."
"The bar charts compare the number of people who used the society webpage in the first and second year.
Looking from an overall perspective, most people visit in the second year of use. Many people used the website in July in the first and second year. While in the first year, few people visited in February compared to September in the second year.
In September, approximately 100 users visited the website in the first year as opposed to 2500 users in the second year. However, the number of visits in the second year was higher than in the first year which was 10000 people and about 50 people respectively. Similarly in July, 22500 individuals used the webpage most often in the second year but under 15000 individuals in the first year.
On the other hand, the number of people who visited was higher in the second year of use. The only exception to this pattern is in August, which declined."
"Wasting food is slowly becoming people's habit in this modern world. This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.
The principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
Wasting food is slowly becoming people's habit in this modern world. This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.
A solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.
In conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food."
"The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.
Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.
In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.
On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000."
"Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.
First and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.
Now, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.
To sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society."
"The bar chart illustrates the figure for uses of a community website during the first and the second year after it is created.
Overall, it can be seen that the number of visits to the website in each month in the second year is more than the figure in the first year noticeably, except for August. Additionally, the website gains popularity differently, depending on the periods of the year.
Looking at the detail, at the beginning of each year the record commences at below 5,000 uses. This figure then plateaus to 10,000 uses and around 17,500 uses in December of the first and the second year respectively. After that, from December to February the website popularity declines to almost zero for the first year which is the lowest record and 10,000 uses for the second year. In the following month, even though the number in the first year increases slightly, the number in the second year remains unchanged.
Nevertheless, between March and June the figure starts to rise for a second time to approximately 12,500 uses in the first year and more than 20,000 uses in the second year. Then, the number of both years stays at this level until July. On August, the popularity in the second year drops to below 15,000 uses while the number in the first year continues increasing, exceeding the number in the second year."
"Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.
To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.
A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.
In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps."

"The diagram illustrate processes of storage area is make from concrete canvas material.
The first step is concrete canvas manufacturing, It is bulit by combine three layers , which is Fibrous top surface, dry concrete and waterproof layer in order, and it is delivered by transportation to the area, then unwrapping the canvas from package to the next stage spreading area on the ground by use pegs on four corner of the 10 metres area with the rope on back of a car. Next step is use airpumping by eject air in the area with airpump which have a door on the opposite to increase area size. then watering the area by spring the water until it have grow to 8 metres, and then let it set by air for 20 to 24 hours.After that, the final outcome can use for storage."
"Many people have a opinion that a women can be a good leader than a men. In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement and many reasons will be provide in this essay.
For the first reason, Leadership is a skill that up to a people, and it is not specific by sexes. In modern world, there are many company that let their department lead by both women and men, and to measure the result for comparing a difference that can be shown on profits that own by each section. For example, It is can be argue if the traditional company is let women firstly lead the project rather than previous, which done by a men. However if the result show profit, so it can be proof that even it is not a men the out come still worthy.
Moreover, Women emphathy in leadership is still significantly reason, we can see that people can be at ease for give more opinions by the mother nature when it come arguement or under pressure at workplace. To illustrate, The research shown comparison of two research teams. the one that lead by women tend to have more ideas post-it and opened opinions than the men team. Obviously, we must agree that women can give more friendly atmosphere for workplace and idea generation for people in her team.
In conclusion, For all reasons mentioned above we can see that a women can have better leadership than the men. For the skills that individual have or the nature emphathy that embrace the collegue."
"The given diagram illustrates how a storage area can be created using concrete canvas.
Overall, the process involves in eight different steps which are manufacturing, delivering, unwrapping, spreading the material on the ground, the use of an air pump followed by the action of watering, setting and storing.
Firstly, the process of creating a storage area starts by manufacturing the concrete canvas which consists of three different layers: the top layer is called the fibrous top surface followed by a layer of dry concrete and a waterproof layer. Next, the material is delivered and unwrapped to be spread out on the ground surface. The spreading process involves in covering an area of 10 metres using pegs and a rope.
Then, under the covered area, some air is pumped through an air pump facing the door. This step is followed by a watering action that reaches 8 metres in height. Finally, the area is left setting for about 20-24 hours until the storage area is created."
"It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.
The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.
In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.
To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view."
"The given diagram illustrates the process of the storage area, which is made from a special material, namely concrete canvas. The process can be outlined in eight consecutive steps, beginning with the manufacturing of the concrete canvas and culminating with storing of goods.
Firstly, the concrete canvas is produced as a three-layers composite. It consists of a fibrous top surface, a layer of dry concrete, and a waterproof layer. The features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability. The finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site, where the boxes are unwrapped, and the canvas inside is taken out.
In the next stage, the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle. In order to fix the canvas on the ground, pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas. After that, on one end of the spread canvas, a door is installed as the entrance of the storage. The covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine. Following that, water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage. Thus, the form of storage is constructed. After a set period of around 20 to 24 hours, the storage can be put into use."
"It is true that gender equality has achieved significant advancements nowadays compared to society in the past, and women have no doubt obtained more opportunities to get engaged in the leading role on many occasions. With regard to many success stories about female leadership, there is a common statement that women are more suited to be leaders. In my opinion, leadership depends more on ability rather than gender.
There are several reasons why some people may consider females as the better choice to occupy the leading position. Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in people’s minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.
Despite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.
In conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender."
"The provided illustrations depict a soda manufacturing procedure. Overall, the process consists of four steps from sanitizing the liquid to packing to delivering the products.
Looking into details, first, raw water, which is the main ingredient, passes through a filter via a tube and flows through a room where water softener and chemicals are added. The liquid is then pumped into a device with electric heaters for the evaporation and carbonation process. In order to lower the tempurature, the heated water travels through a cooling pipe to another container to mix with carbon dioxide.
Moving on to the next stage, a pipe connects the carbonated water from the second stage to a mixing tank. Here, colourings, syrup and flavour are added according to the designated look and taste of the final product. After that, the mixture passes through another filter before filling into containers. Lastly, the bottles and cans are then packed into packaging and delivered to stores, ready to be sold to consumers."
"It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.
First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.
The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.
All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced."
"The figure displays the process of how carbonated drinks are made in a factory. There is a total of 5 stages in which the initial step is processing water, and the final step is the packaging.
To put into detail, water cleaning is the starting process. Row water is delivered into the processing area through the filter. Substances making the water softer and some kinds of chemicals are added into and mixed. Thereafter the processed water is moved into the step of carbonation. The moved water is heated in electric heaters and passed through cooling pipe to the space filled with carbon dioxide. The water is carbonated in this area. After that, this carbonated water is carried into the mixing tank through the long pipe, and mixed with coloring, syrup, and flavor there. Finally, the carbonated drink is extracted through the filter and it is filled into tons of bottles and cans. Canned and bottled drinks are packaged and delivered to supermarkets."
"With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.
Having considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools."
"The diagram contains information about the manufacturing of carbonated drinks. In general, the process has five main stages, which start with water cleaning and end with packing.
In the first stage, water is cleaned, in order to do this step water is filtered, softened, and processed with chemicals. Then water is pumped to electrical heaters, which prepare it to enter the second stage. In the second stage water is cooled through a special pipe and processed with carbon dioxide. In the following stage carbonated water is mixed with colors, syrups, and flavors, in order to complete this stage mixing tank is needed. In the fourth stage water can be filtered and filled into bottles and cans. Finally, carbonated drinks are packed and delivered to supermarkets.
The process of manufacturing carbonated drinks has five main stages. In order to manufacture carbonated drinks special machines are needed. Raw water should go through filters, softeners, chemicals, heaters and cooling pipes. Also, it needs to go through a carbonization process and be mixed with supplies such as syrups, flavors and colors."
"Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.
The rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin – now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.
Nevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.
To conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks. Communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives, who are living on another edge of the planet."
"The diagram illustrates how carbonated drinks can be produced starting from raw water.
Overall, five steps are part of the process. The first three stage involve filtering, carbonating and mixing the water with other flavourish products. Then, the final drinks are bottled and packaged for consumption.
To start, raw water is filtered and softener and chemicals are added. The purified water is pumped into an electrical heater where evaporates so that it can flow through a cooling pipe in the following container. During this stage, carbon dioxide is added. The carbonated water, in a liquid form, is transfered in a mixing tank. Multiple substance are located in various tab at the bottom of the mixing tank, such as colouring, syrup and flavour. Ultimately, these liquids are mixed with the carbonated water.
It is evident that before selling the product to supermarkets, it needs to be filtered and bottled in cans or bottles. Then, it is packaged and delivered to grocer shops."
"In today's globalised world, the introduction of smart devices and the Internet have definitely changed the way mankind communicates. It is argued that negative consequences due to the modern communication technology can be shown in relationships of any kind. Although, some people may have difficulty to engage in person with others, the advanced devices allow human-being to mantain relationship around the world and improve their contact network.
People who believe that the introduction of new technology has negative effect on how we related to other could have a point. More human-beings are comfortable with new technologies due to the elimination of anxiety or stressful feelings triggered by face-to-face meetings. Moreover, modern devices allow erasing unprofessional or informal messages with a simple click of a button. Despite the fact that people might lose the ability to communicate correctly at the first attempt, these recent technologies offer more opportunity, encouraging shy and not confident personality.
The internet and modern devices connect people around the world expanding their connections through different continents. It is well known that creating a vast network of connections is crucial for buissness allowing expansion or firms merging. Not only it ease working meeting guarantee excellent performances from distance, but also this new technology are increasing connectivity between mankind so that friendship can be saved and language barriers can be a dwindle obstacle.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the modern communication technologies have a positive impact on mankind's life, improving their relationship, offering solution to less confident people and implementing network of connection among companies. Therefore, the positive effects of these new way of communicate far outweight the negative one's."
"The diagram above shows the procedure of how carbonated beverages are made. It has 5 Stages, from the water cleansing process, heating evaporation and carbonation, mixing all the ingredients, filtering and filling, and packaging process of carbonated water until the products ready to be shipped and be sold in the market.
In the first stage process, raw water runs through the filtering process alongside the water softener and chemicals. After the water has already cleansed and ready to be pumped and flow to the next stage. On Stage 2, the water flow to the electric heaters and to the cooling pipe to be evaporated and carbonated with the substance of Carbon Dioxide. The next stage, is the mixing process in a tank, which carbonate water mixes well with colouring, syrup, and flavour. Fourth stage, is the process of filtering the water and then it be filled to all the empty bottles and cans and to the next step packaging. In the last stage, after gathering all the products in boxes, they will be shipped to the supermarkets. All of these processes create huge amounts of carbonated beverages with advance technology in the production process, surely it will be a success in retail."
"The existence of modern technology could lead efficiency with the fastest way to deliver a message through their handphones, but it also have side effects whether it is bad or good. I disagree if many people think high-tech communication have some negative effects when it comes to social relationships.
In today's world, people are tend to have a smartphones as their daily needs. Smartphone is designed to make people's life more easier, simpler, and accessible which can be used everywhere and anywhere. Many companies and organizations applied technology in our daily lives and it is called ""Internet of Things"" which connect the electronic devices to get access through the internet everywhere. This surely be a solution for everyone's to get access and communicate easier with other people inside the smartphone that has the applications that provided social media. Despite that, it is obvious the present of technology in mobile phone will be easier for everyone who networking with people who far away through smartphones.
Lack of communications is one of the problem that common in relationships. With using the social media to network with people more easily will be helpful for several people. Not only for communicate and connect but also for collaborate and gather ideas comfortably using platform that has provided in working areas will prevent from any kind of innarticulate.
Consequently, government and large companies has provided very pleasant program to make people communicate without any effort because of the large network that can be accessed everywhere. Furthermore, people will be sociable in just a blink of an eye."
"This illust displays all the procedures by which olive oil is produced from olives. There is a total of seven steps where the initial step is to pick some olives, and the final step is to extract only olive oil from pressed olive paste.
To put into detail, obtaining enough amounts of olive is the starting process. Picked olives are rinsed in cold water. After that, rinsed olives are delivered into a smashing machine through belts. This machine enables olives to divide into olive paste and olive stones. Thereafter, only olive paste is put into hollow bags and carried into the pressing process. Olive paste inside the bag is pressed and further move into separating process. A portion of olive oil is completely removed from the rest of water portion. Finally, extracted olive oil is delivered to storages and on the market if necessarily. This is the complete process of olive oil production."
"With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.
Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history."
"This progress diagram illustrates the process of how to produce olive oil from the trees on farms till the final stage which is selling the product in the market. Overall, olive oil must go through 7 processes to have pure olive oil. From the trees in the farms to the third stage, we have to separate the olive stones and the olive paste using a smasher to get only the olive oil, as well as divide the oil and the water before distributing the product to the market.
According to what is shown after having a ripe olive from the farms, the farmer must pick the olive and put them in cold water to clean it from particles. After that belt it and send it to a smashing machine to squeeze the olive stones. Then, the olive pastes must be packed in pages with holes to keep them fresh as long as possible.
Regarding the last 3 stages, the pages should be under pressing tools, following that passed to a pressing machine. As a result, we could separate the water from the oil and, finally the oil arrives in the storages and it will be ready to distribute it at any time in a fresh condition"
"There is no argument that history is something related to the past generation which has never been seen by the present generation. which let some people think that history has nothing to teach us or has limited information. While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.
On one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
On the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.
In conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information. Finally, I believe that technology helped us recently to study those strange tools. consequently, the government should pay more attention to covering the experiment's expenses."
"The picture shows the process of olive oil production. The process includes the following stages.
1. A worker pickes olives from trees amd put them to bowls.
2. The picked olives are washed at special machine by cold water. This operation distinguishes also bad collected pieces such as tree's sheets, small dirts and so on.
3. Then the belt conveyer transports the olives to the smash machine. The machine design includes rotary part with special disc. The disc moves around the rotation axis and smashes the olives out. The process gives olive paste and olive stones.
4. Workers put the bottles with olive paste to special bags with holes and deliver them to the press.
5. Pressing of olive paste.
6. The pressed pieces are brought to the separaing machine. The machine separates the pressed pieces of olive paste onto oil and water.
7. The oil is delivered to storage and furthur to shops."
"There are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.
The first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.
The second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.
I think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver. So, I think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life."
"The given table displays data about the staple foods incorporated in diet in Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and Mexico. Units are measured in calories per person per day.
Overall, rice is mostly ingested in higher amounts of calories per individual as per day in Cambodia while Mexicans ingest most calories from maize per day. Poland has the least amounts of calorie intake in rice and none in maize.
Cambodia consumes 1445 and 103 calories of rice and maize respectively whereas Poland constitutes to 19 calories from rice. However, Poland incorporates more calories from wheat with 865 more than Cambodia which amounts to 18. Of all the countries, Poland does not have a record of calorie consumption from maize and adding up all calories eaten, it is the least country with calory consumption in total.
Egypt incorporates 1095 calories from wheat while Mexico amounts to 275. Further, maize constitutes of higher calories in Mexico with 1083 of intake against Egypt which records 578 calories. Rice in Egypt and Mexico comprises of 501 and 57 respectively."
"Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.
To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.
Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.
Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.
To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated."
"THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.
If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.
To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption."
"This essay will talk about the importance or not of spending lots of money on family celebrations.
Family celebrations are always important, at least for catholics as it happens in my country, Spain. Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear. Almost every family with children receiving the communion will choose to organize a big party, inviting all family members and friends, and organizing something special for children such as going to Disneyland Park (or any other theme park). The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.
On one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.
But, I can´t see the point on spending so much money.
I have been a kid of the ""old school"". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.
In conclusion I stick to the point of less is more also in this discussion. I still believe that family celebrations must remain familiar without big events but surrounded by the ones you really love and care of."
"This figure indicates how much each basic carbo products (wheat, maize, and rice) people in each country consume in a day. As an overview, it can be clearly seen that rice is the most consumed in Cambodia, Egyptian people tend to eat more wheat than other basic food, and Mexico is the biggest consumer of maize in the selected countries.
People in Cambodia eat rice the most among these four countries, which is 1445 calories per person per day. A big difference can be seen between the other countries. The next is Egypt with 501 calories. People in Mexico use rice as a nutritional source for only 57 calories, while people in Poland 19 calories. On the other hand, wheat has a totally different pattern to rice consumption. Egyptian obtain the most energy, 1095 calories, through wheat in a day, which is followed by Poland with 865 calories. Mexico is also a little consumer of wheat with 275 calories. Cambodia intake the least calories from wheat in these countries with only 18%. When it comes to maize, Mexico records the highest calories intake among four countries, which is 1083 calories. Consumption of maize is Egypt is the second highest with 578 calories, which is more than Cambodia with only 103 calories. No maize is consumed in Poland."
"With the development of society, people have more options for how they spend their own money compared with the previous generations. There is an ongoing debate about whether it is essential or not to invest money in family celebrations. In my opinion, spending a lot of money on family celebration would definitely bring more precious experiences to us. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.
To begin with, squandering my own money for my family is significantly meaningful. Specifically, an important person for us, such as my wife or my children, may be out of my sight suddenly someday. Nobody can predict what is going to happen in the future. Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.
On the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world. The compelling example of this is that having a trip with someone, surely having a good relationship, enables us to feel more satisfaction than alone. I suppose that spending money for others is a key to making myself more happier.
Having all the arguments above, I strongly recommend people spend their money on family celebrations enough to make family members satisfied."
"These two charts show the rate of employment of Australian people, separated in gender and three groups of range of age. In the two charts, they all displays that middle-aged adults are the main working population, and the percentage of men working was more than women in the past. Nowadays, the population of women going to work has increased. Interestingly, the population of adolescent’s employment seems declined. The percentage of men employed in aged 15-19 has an approximately 10% to 15% decrease in this 30 years interval, while there is just a slightly decline in women employed in aged 15-19. Another phenomenon worth mentioning is that the elder population employed in women has a large amount of increase during the 30 years. This result is possibly due to the increase of working population in middle-aged women in the same time interval."
"Science, as a fundamental subject, is significant for the development of technique. It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.
The basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countries’ fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.
In developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living. While in the developing or non-developed countries, there is a huge amount of the population doing farming or working in basic industrial area, which are not necessary in the usage of Science field."
"The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.
In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.
The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.
Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women."
"Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively."
"These bar graphs shows who were employed among Australian females and males in three different years 1984, 2001 and 2014 including the age group of 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64.
It is clear from the graph that the age group 35-44 years old has the highest rate of employment among the three years of 1984, 2001 and 2014 and in both sexes.
According to what is shown, in men bar graph, specifically in the 35-44 age group, the percentage did not change through out the years. While the younger group 15-19 employment percentage has been increasing from 1984 to 2001 and 2014. Additionally, older Australian people category 60-64 years old who were employed in 2014 is more than 1984 and 2001.
On the other hand, women in the middle age group 35-44 employment got higher with time from the year 1984 to 2001 and 2014. Furthermore, teenagers from 15-19 agre group slightly decreased in employment level in 2014. While elderly from 60-64 got more jobs in 2014.
In conclusion, we could say that the two age groups of 35-44 and 60-64 had higher percentage in 2014. In contrast, age group 15-19 had lower percentage by the year 2014."
"In my opinion, I consider that science subjects studies are crucial for a better communities and future. There are some countries that should teach science in wider range and value.
There are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. First of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. Moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.
On the other hand, in result of the science negligence in these countries, we would see a lower awareness among the society which also affects the rate of science discovery and innovations. In another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life. There are several suggestions in my opinion is important to implement in the educaion and parenting systems to ensure a adequate scientific base for childern and students. To begin with, we could add the basic subects in schools like; Physics, Chemistry and Biology as a start and then increase the complexity of the lessons and science theories each grade. Additionally, parents could read simple science books to their children from the very first years of life so they can have a good platform to the scientific ideas of the universe.
In conclusion, science is crucial for better life and future, specially to the next generation education systems. So, countries and leaders should enhance that side."
"The bar charts show information about Australian male and female employment situation in the years of 1984, 2001 and 2014.
Overall, it can be seen that employers trended to hire the people who aged 35 to 44 gradually. However, percentage of the elderly employment increased overtime.
Focusing on the chart showing data of male employment, there were about 90% of middle-aged man (aged 35-44) were employed at all of these three recorded years, which was the highest figure. 60% the teenagers aged between 15 to 19 were employed at 1984 and 2001, and it decreased to 50% at 2014. However, the percentage of employed elderly men rose to 60% in 2014 from 35% at 1984.
Regarding woman, at 1984, the young girls aged 15 to 19 were the most popular group in labour market with 60% of them who were employed. At 2001, the figure of female aged 35 to 44 was crossover younger group to about 70%, and it increased to 75% at 2014. In addition, the percentage of the elderly women employed increased overtime to 45% at 2014 from 10% at 1984."
"Science is one of the most important thing to develop country. However, a lot of countries have not enough students to take part in this subject. I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.
First, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.
Science influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power. All the social issues will finally affect the financial stability and cause some sorrowful tragedies.
In summary, science is a key stone to develop a wealthy country. The government can modify their strategies and improve the academic environment in studying science."
"In this essay I will try to give an overview and comparisan between men/women in Australia and their group of ages in terms of empoyment and sees how things were in 1984 until now.
Firstly let us take men;
it seems that men from 33-44 of age always required and with have the best employment rcored over the the years with stable precentage which is almost 90%.
For the eldest, 60-64, there numbers seems to be grown over the years, started from 30% in 1984 until 2001 and jumbed into almost 55%.
For the youngest, boys from 15-19 seems to have a better numbers on the past wich maybe related to the rules and reglations that we have today.
As we can see that there number drooped from above 60% to 50%.
Secondly, women;
Women with ages 60-64 are now have more chances of employment, in 1984 there were only 10% and they got increased over the years with a double figure in 2001 with 20% and now in 2014 with over 40%.
The prime age for working women seems to be 35-44 with above a 40% over the years and getting increasing year by year until it reachis 90% in 2014.
Last group are the 15-19 employed women, with a balanced recored since 1984 until 2001 they were 60% with a slight change in 2014 drooping only 5%.
In cnculsion, We could say that the group of 35-44 are the most employed in Australia weather it's women or men where the group of 60-64 are the bottom list."
"In this essay I will discuss and showcase the reasons of not having enough studints the study science subjects and the reflection of that on the society.
The way I see this matter is there is a couple of major causes which includes the following;
Firstly, socity reasons;
Well, usually in each country pepole will lead some ideology thoughts and movments on certain topics and trends where focusing on certin major or studies considered to be the best decision that you can take which will lead to a great opportuntites for you as an indvedual and we all know that today people sees the scince as thing that will give you a knwoledge not an amazing future.
Having said that, it will directly causes an impact on the students and many of them will decides to explore another areas rather than a science subjects.
Secondly, Religious reasons
You maybe surprised to read this however, it's actullay one of the issues that causes the lack of having enough students studying science.
The best way to explain this reason is by example where in Saudi Arabia between the 1990 until 2013 a Religious were preaching peploe about the danger of studing science and that they should only focus on religion subjects.
Having that happend now will causes a lot to the society, where people will be less educated about the basics of our world.
In cunclusion, the way I see it that each countrt must enforce the studying of science subjects atleast untill the first year of college."
"The given chart illustrates the percentages of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. The information provided is divided in four different activities: dressing, homework, playing gamnes and preparing for bed. In addition the information is segregated by sex when actions are done separately.
The activity where parents spend more time together is playing games with their children. They dedicate almost 70% of the time spent in this activity together. In the opposite side we observe the activity of dressing childrens which is developed by parents together only 20% of the time.
Homework is developed by both parets almost a 40% of the time spent and preparing children to go to bed 50% of the time spent.
If we make a comparison of mothers versus fathers, there are two activities where women spend more time than men: dressing and homeworg. I would like to pinpoint the large difference in the dressing activity where women dedicate more than 70% of the time spent whilst men only dedicate approximately 2% of the time spent."
"This essay will talk about the general increase in talking about money.
I will expose why I believe this is a negative development.
In worldwilde terms there has been a general society empoverishment.
In general terms, inflation has beaten the entire world very hard due to the fluctuations in energy prices, furthermore the war between Russia and Ucrania has worsen even more this fluctuation as Russia has almost stopped suppling Gas to Europe. On the other hand Ucrania was the biggest Europe´s seed warehouse and our economy at the food industry has also been affected by huge price increase.
However salaries have not been rised up enough to reach inflation rate which directly has driven society to a loss of value. This fact induces us to speak more often and more in detail about prices, about our salaries or about our home rentals. Population wonders how come our governments are not settling different actions to repair this huge loss which is causing biggest wealth inequality rates, dividing even more the society between wealthy and poors and sending a lot of population to thicken ""the under the poverty line"" population .
Newspapers and communication agencies daily inform about war status, but lately they are forgoting to insist on the economy crash we are suffering. Only in France there have been important strikes to report their disomfort with the enlargement of the retirement age as well as the general price increase.
To summarise, the economical situation worldwide is wobbling, and the least we can do is talking about it."
"The graph presents information on the time spent by both parents while taking care of their children in the evening hours during the year of 2022. Overall, men tend to have less involvement in the mentioned job; however, they spent more hours if the job was performed together with their wifes. Women do the majority of the work alone.
In more detail, men rarely got involved in dressing, while women in fact has the major part in dressing with approxemately 75%. Although men put 10% of their time helping in homework, women put five times more doing the same job. Both parents made up togther slightly less than 40% when teaching their children, where as both of them spent almost half of the time in dressing.
Moreover, both parents accounted for 70% having a pleasure time with their children during playing games, while playing separatly accounted for around 30% for both. Mothers also put the major effort in preparing their children for bed, while fathers spent significantly less time doing this task which was around 5%; however, this task was mainly performed by both of them with a percentage of 50%."
"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.
Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.
In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life."
"The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.
To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.
In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed."
"Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.
To begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.
Furthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.
Although having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.
In conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects."
"This bar chart shows the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022.
First, there have four different types of home activities: dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. Also there have three different types of people that spent time taking care of their children in the evening.
Then, for dressing and homework, the mothers are spent their time taking care of their children (dressing: around 75%; homework: 50%); For playing games and preparing for bed, the mothers and fathers both to spent their time with their children in the evening (playing games: 70%; preparing for bed: 50%).
In a word, in a family, the fathers don't want to only that spend time taking care of their children. In other words, the mothers are indispensable member of the family, because she has to do almost everything in the family. So, the mothers and fathers should both to spent their time with their children in the evening, such as dressing and homework."
"In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).
This phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:
1. Inner hypocrisy;
2. Lack of confidence in oneself;
3. Thinking and vision.
First of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.
Secondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.
Finally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.
In a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better."
"The bar chat shows information about how parents spent time in taking care of their children among four events in the evening in 2022.
Overall, it can be obviously seen that mothers spent much more amount of time in taking care of the child than fathers generally. Playing games was the most popular event that parents play with their children together of four types of event.
First, dressing had a relatively extreme situation. There were the highest figure that mothers spent about 75% of time in dressing of their children. However, fathers only spent 3% of time in it showing the lowest figure. Second, fathers spent 10% of time in doing homwork with their children, which was the most popular event of fathers.
Third, both fathers and mothers did not tend to spent time in playing game with their children independently with 5% and 25% respectively, but they spent 70% of time in this event if they did it together. As for praparing for bed, they spent 50% of time in it. However, even when mother did it individually, they also spent about 43% of time in it."
"It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.
Money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.
However, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying ""freedom"" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.
In summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money."
"From the chart, we can easily find four household activities that parents do with their children, resepcetively dressing, homework, playing games and preparing for bed.
In terms of dressing, mothers have a very high percentage of participation of over 70%, while fathers seem to have little involvement in this part (less than 5 percent). Homework is also where mothers alone devote more time with the children(roughly 50 percent) compared with only 10 percent for fathers, and both parents together have also spent some time helping kids' homework(aruond 35-40%). When it comes to playing games and preparing for bed, it looks like more like a family activity since the participation of both parents, respectively 70% and 50 %, outpercentages that of a single parent in total. Also, Playing games is an activity that mothers alone spend the least time with their children compared with other activities, which only occupies around 25 percent of the total time.
In conlusion, we can clealy see that fathers fail to spend very much time with their kid independently as all the data reveals a less that 10 percent devotion of time. Meanwhile, both parents can do more in dressing and homework to further their relationship with their kids."
"As we are living into a monetary society, it's unavoidable for people to discuss about money matters in daily conversation about housing mortgage, salaries and other living expenses. The financial anxiety has become a main source of headache that lingers on especially for the young generation who has to bear the increasing burden of a city life. From a standpoint of a college student, I believe it's not a postive development that should have occurred in our modern society.
When our conversation turns to money issues, it doesn's really help up with our status quo, but only further exacerbates social anxiety by unnecessay comparison and higher expectation. I personally have similar experiences when friends start to talk about their monthly pocket money and daily luxuries they prefer. We are widely variated in family background, social classes and opportunities. If our daily social discourses are always filled with monetary issues, it is only widening the social gaps between different groups of people and making our society a place less inclusive for underprevilaged people.
Additionally, money-oriented conversations might as well shape our world perspective into a very pratical, highly self-interested and boring one, which is full of daily trifles and calculation. In book The Little Prince, he says adult will only appreciate a house when you tell them that it is worth a million pounds. It exactly depicts the moderntime conversations that value things more a monetary basis. But the problem we cannot perch on the path of money and many of our lifelong persuit doesn't rely sorely on our income and expensive services and luxaries. We are neither willing nor prepared to see a world where romance can be purchased, friendship ca be transacted and even life itself has a certain value that can be measured in dollars.
So I would really like to call on more people to rid money discussions our of their daily chats and share more about what's interesting in their seemingly mundane lives, some recent photos of an outing, newly met friends and others. Create meanings of life not through talks about money, but upon something more important to our own existance."

"The diagram illustrates the difference between parents in four tasks of nighttime childcare in 2022.
Overall, women were significantly more involved with caring for children than their partners. In addition, the attendance rate among these four tasks and parents varied.
Regarding mothers, around 75% engaged with dressing, while half assisted with children's homework. Another roughly 42% prepared for bed, and 25% played games with their kids.
On the other hand, although most fathers cared about their children's homework, the figure was only 10%. Conversely, dressing was the least favorite thing among the four tasks for the fathers; probably just 2% were involved with it while playing games and preparing for bed were equally preferred by 5% of the fathers.
Furthermore, 70% of both parents played games with their kids at night, but the data was nearly halved when it came to homework assistance. The least number of parents engaged with dressing was over 20%; nevertheless, the ratio of preparing for bed almost doubled."
"Material achievement has been discussed at a high frequency in some countries; people widely involve this topic in every aspect of their lives. This essay will give two possible reasons for this phenomenon and explain the negative impacts on society.
Two major causes keep people lingering on this topic. Firstly, the difficulties in earning a living in some countries have significantly drawn people's focus on finance. For instance, more job opportunities are needed for job seekers in countries with low productivity. Besides that, in many low-income countries, people have to endure low pay; in some extreme cases, their earnings can not cover their spending. Therefore, tremendous anxiety cause people from these countries constantly talk about their financial situations.
On the other side, flaunting is becoming the mainstream mindset in some countries. Commonly, in some countries that just escaped poverty, the increasing spared money makes showing off possible. People in these countries display their wealth by owning luxurious items, such as branded bags or jewelry. Therefore, money naturally becomes essential in their conversations.
Although the reasons for money focusing vary, it might develop into risky societal factors. If the frequent discussion of finance is due to insufficient employment or inadequate wages, it is an alarm to the governments to carry on measures of boosting industries' development. Otherwise, riots might be expected and harm social safety. Furthermore, this widespread discussion highly leads to material comparison, which harms morality and even allows crimes to occur. When individuals obsess with showing off, they feel the shame of disposing of the downsides. To maintain a perfect image- especially a wealthy appearance, some people even turn to crime, such as stealing or robbery.
To conclude, folks popularly discuss money for various reasons, such as the demands of work or psychological factors. However, the phenomenon is not a positive sign to society and most likely indicates the upcoming crisis."
"The table indicates the population figures for four countries from 2003; and the predicted figure for 2025 and 2050. Overall, an increase can be seen in three countries, Argentina, Indonesia, and the Republic of Korea from 2003 to 2050 while a reduction also can be seen in Italy in 2050.
To go into detail, Indonesia predominantly has the highest population than the other three countries from 2003 to 2050. The population is 238 million, 274 million, and 312 million in 2003, 2025, and 2050 respectively. In addition, the same phenomenon can be seen in Argentina. The population was 34 million which is the lowest population. Afterward, the population will steadily increase to 48 million, and 62 million. Argentina will result in the second-highest population among the four countries.
Interestingly, the population of the Republic of Korea will increase from 48 million to 52 million in 2025. The population will remain the same at 52 million in 2050.
When it comes to Italy, the population was 54 million and it was the second highest population among the four countries in 2003. On the other hand, the population will drop to 47 million in 2025, and keep slightly decreasing the population in 2050. It will be 45 in 2050."
"In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.
To begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.
In addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This
means that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.
Furthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.
In conclusion, the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries' economic growth in the long term."
"The graph indicates the population in various nations in 2023 respectively, along with it, forcasts regarding the number of residents in surveyed regions in 2025 and 2050.
Overall, the majority of nations are expected to experience a growth in coming years, except Italy, which the figure is predicted to go through a downward trend. On the other hand, Indonesia contain the largest figure of residents, while the least number shown in Argentina.
In 2003, there were 238 millions people lived in Indonesia, which was 7 times larger than that of Argentina, in which the group of indoesian will continue to expand to 312 millions by 2050. Although Argentina was where has the leasat number of residents in 2003, the figure will go through a rise to 62 millions as the second biggest population among surveyed nations.
Italy is the only regions that display a drop over times, from 54 millions in 2003, it is expected to lost 9 millions of residents by 2050. As for Republic of Korea, the figure is barely changed between 2025 and 2050 at 52 millions."
"Regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, I could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.
To begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. In this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. For example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.
On the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. Take the UK as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.
To summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. However, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. Therefore, I could only partially agree with such opinions."
"The given chart illustrates the real population figures of 2003 for four countries which are Argentina, Indonesia, Italy and The Republic of Korea. In addition the chart provides projected figures for the years of 2025 and 2050.
The population is mesured in millions.
The population in Indonesia is the most numerous in all the periods we are comparing. Argentina has the less numerous population in 2003, however this country enlarges its population enough until 2050 to become the second most populated country out of the four, with an increase of population of around 90% from 2003 to 2050.
If we observe the behaviour of Republic of Korea, we can see its population grows from 2003 to 2025 from 48 to 52, approximately a 10%, and stops its growt by then, keeping the same population figure until 2050.
Italy is the only country whose population decreases in all periods, more than a 10% from 2003 with 54 to 2025 with 47, and from 2025 to 2050 from 47 to 45.
We can conclude that in the coming 47 years the medium developped countries will increase their population as Indonesia, whilst the more developped countries will decrease it, as Italy."
"This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.
There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.
And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.
If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.
In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.
The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.
To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.
Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation."
"The table indicates the population of four countries in 2003, as well as the predicted data for the years 2025 and 2050.
Overall, Indonesia was the country having the largest population and is projected to increase in future. In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.
First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.
However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050."
"Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.
On the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.
On the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.
In summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help."
"The excel shows the total population amount in 2003 and its projection for 2025 and 2050 in four countries: Argentina, Indonesia, Italy and Republic of Korea.
Overall, for every years which were considered, Indonesia is the most population country, Argentina represents a constantly increase. On the other hand, Italy predicts a decrease and Republic of Korea remain almost the same.
Argentina is the country wich one hope for a biggest percentege of growth on its population. For 2025 the projected a rise of more than fourty percentage and thirty percentage for 2050. The population of 2050 are the double of 2003.
Indonesia also expects a climb in their population, but not so significant. The number is approximmately 10 to 15% for each period.
Republic of Korea also considering a low increase, under than 10% for 2025 and a plateau for 2050.
By contrast, Italy are expecting for a minimum decrease for their population. The first deep represented almost 12% for 2025 and the second one less than 5%."
"Nowadays many people argue that univerties graduation should be sponsouring by governments institution in other to provide this level of education for each one who desires it. I disagree with this argument as, in my opinion, isn't a governments role provide a higher education for the whole society.
First of all, the most important government task is guarantee a better level of basic education. So having great public schools to fundamental level, enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship, when it is necessary. Governments shouldn't spend public money in graduation or higher level education, in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education.
Another public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven't enouth money to pay full tuition fees. These type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they've concluded the course. This kind of financial should consider that payment only starts after the end of their course.
In conclusion, I would argue that having the government paying the fees for university studies isn't looks to be a good solution to guarantee an university access for whole population. States should keep investing and execute their role to persue the best fundamental public education and might enable their students to get into any university. If those student haven't enouth money or condition to pay all fees, states only need to provide a special credits to them."
"The table below indicates the current and expected population figures of four different countries, that are Argentina, Indonesia, Italy and the Republic of Korea.
Overall, all countries except Italy are displaying a growing population. The only differences are in the ampliude of this progression and also the special case that is Italy.
Between 2003 and the projected numbers of 2025, major changes have occured. In the begining, Argentina was the country with the smallest population while Italy and Korea were a bit higher. Although, this quickly changed, due to the countries taking different paths. Both populations in Korea and Argentina are projected to increase by 4 million, while Italy's population is supposed to decrease. Indonesia, the country with the biggest population, is projected to grow reaching 274 million people.
Between the expected numbers of 2025 and those of 2050, contrary to the previous years, Argentina's population growth should surpass the one of Korea, making it the second most populous country of the list. Indonesia's population should continue to increase, welcoming 40 million more citizens. On the other hand, Italy should continue its recession, going down to 45 million people."
"Going to university is an important step in life. It will majorly impact their futurs, and will define them in many ways. Unfortunatly, this is an expensive task that not everyone can afford. Thit is the reason why some people think that governments should pay course fees for university students. In this essay, I will explain why I think governments should help students of universities financially by paying their course fees.
To begin with, this could make universities more inclusive and help some students achieve their dreams. Some people, due to their economic background, are forced to attend specific establishments, even though they would give anything to be somewhere else. This is an important cause of class differences, and the source of many disciminations today. This is why, offering to pay for their course fees, would considerably help students that are less wealthy, and fight against inequalities.
To illustrate this argument, here is an example. Some of my class-mates receive a specific amount of money from an organization, that helps them study at my shool. They find it amazing because, now they are not only defined by their parents' income anymore, and they have the opportunity to accomplish whatever they wish in life.
Secondly, an enormous amount of students live in a precarous situation, so by paying their course fees they could have a more stable life. University life is rough, you are not with your family, you have to manage so many different things for the first time, one of which being money. Some students have little to no money that they can spend in recreational activities, a big part of it being assigned to accomodations, school fees and food. By paying some of their fees, students could benefit from the money and do what they enjoy. This could help them mentally and make them enjoy life a bit more.
On the other hand, I can understand that if governments had to pay for the course fees of every students, it would represent a tremendous amount of money that could be invested in other and more pressing matters. Although, I do still think that providing this aid could have more benefits than downsides.
In conclusion, the governments shoulp help students by paying their course fees. This could open some students to new opportunities or help others live in better conditions. Students are the futur of every states, that's why I invite everyone reading this to invest in them."

"The table displays the amount of people living in different countries nowadays and prediction for population growth in those countries for 2025 and 2050.
It is estimated that almost all of the countries will show a population growth till 2025. There is only Italy, which population is going to fall in the next decades. In comparison, such countries as Argentina and Indonesia are projected to increase greatly in terms of population. Among others Indonesian population is the one that will gradually increase till 2050. Despite the fact that all other countries are going to show either decrease or increase, Republic of Korea is the only country which is predicted to have the same amount of inhabitants in 2025 and next quarter of century as well. Overall, only Italy's population won't increase in next 25 years. Moreover, it will loose almost 10 millions of its inhabitants."
"It is believed that governments ought to pay full institutional fees for students who want to obtain higher education. I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.
To start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.
On the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.
In conclusion, paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying"
"The line graph illustrates the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities between 2001 to 2010.
Firstly, it is noticeable that new commencing overseas students consistantly increased over 10 year. The angle of inclination even grew in most of period as well, except between 2009 and 2010. Likewise, the number of total enroled foreign students increased gradually. The number of overseas students was 20000 in 2001, but it reached to 80000 in 2010.
Whereas, the number of new native students remained steady in the same period. The number of commencing local students recorded more or less 20000 in every period between 2001 and 2010. Meanwhile, the total number of local students grew until 2007, from 40000 to 60000. However after 2007, the number stayed constant near 60000.
To sum up, the total number of student grew whether they are overseas students or local students, between 2001 and 2010. However, the number of commencing overseas students grew in the same period, while the number of native commencing students stayed steady."
"I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.
Seoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers
On the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.
As we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases. The success in hosting international games depends on many elements. Time of the game is important, and global atmosphere is important as well. Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful."
"The given two charts represent the information about how many students study in Australian universities during the period of ten years, from 2001 to 2010. The first graph shows data about overseas students, the second about local students. Also the data separated by commencing and total types of students.
Overall, from 2001 to 2010 the amount of overseas students increased and exceeded local students at the end of the given period. The same situation was with commencing and with total types of students. Despite the fact that the total quantity of local students has sharply increased too, the amount of commencing students was approximately without any changings.
The number of overseas students in total was 20000, however in 2010 it rapidly reached 80000 students in 2010. Amount of commencing students had the same situation, though in 2009 speed of increasing had reduced and stabilized at 40000 students.
The sum of local students from 2001 to 2007 significantly climbed up to 600000 students in total, but from 2007 to 2010 this value fluctuated within the same digit."
"Some people believe that arranging worldwide sports is a nice idea for the country and it will give some benefits, while others suggest that is an awful idea. From my point of view, It is a brilliant idea for the country and for citizens when they host and are owners of international sports events.
On the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not. I remember that in that time were a lot of discussion in TV and in the internet,
On the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example ""eurovision"" or ""olympic games"" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live. For example, in 2018 Russia hosted a world football games, and this event invited a large number of foreign specialists and investors.
In conclusion, although hosting international sport events could be very expensive, the benefits which it could give to the citizens and to government institutes overload any disadvantages. I believe that each country should try to do it more."
"The line graphs compare the enrollments of students from overseas and local areas in Australian universities between 2001and 2010.
It is clear that the total number of enrollment of local students was always higher than that of overseas students. While the commencing number of local students remained stable, the number of the enrollments of students from overseas saw an upward trend.
In 2001, while the commencing figure for enrollments of students from overseas was approximately 16000, the number of those coming from local regions was around 170000, more than 10 times of the figure for the former. There was a huge gap from the total number of students enrolled from overseas and local areas in 2001, with 20000 and 400000 respectively.
Over the period of 10 years, the commencing line of enrollment of local students remained relatively stable, with the highest number peaking at 220000 after a small rise in 2002, seeing a slightly decline to the same figure of 2001 and reaching to 200000 in 2010. The commencing number of overseas students witnessed a dramatical rise from 16000 in 2001 to about 40000 in 2010. The total number of overseas students also showed a drastical increase, soaring to the summit of 81000 in 2010 while the total enrollments number of local students increased from the original 400000 to the peak at 600000 in 2007 and remained a four-year consecutive same figure in 2010."
"People hold different views about the benefits of hosting an international sports. While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.
On the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.
On the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.
In conclusion, I can understand why people are unwilling to hold an international sports event, but it seems to me that more advantages of hosting one event like that outweigh than that of not conducting one."
"The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.
The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.
For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.
To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007."
"International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.
Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.
The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.
Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective."

"The line chart illustrated percentage of unemployed person during the year 2012 in Australia.
First of all, during the first half of the year 2012, the unemployment rate was higher in rural areas than in urban areas. In rural zone, the percentage decreased during the first two part of the year. In contrast, in urban areas the percentage of people without job increased over the same period. In the last part of 2012, the rate in both areas tend to stayed stable on the whole.
During the first and second part of the year, unemployment in urban areas growed up from just over 2% to 4%. This number dropped down between the second and the third part of the year to just over 2%. A sharply change occur at the beggining of the third year, the percentage of unemployed person raised up to reach a peak just above 5%.
At the same time, for rural areas, the rate of unmployed people dropped down from 6.5% to just abover 4.5%. Afterthat, the rate remained slightly stable during the last two part. We can saw a peak at the end of second part where the percentage peak at 5.4%.
To conclude, the unemployment was different at the beginning of 2012 and tend to stabilize around 5% at the end of the year 2012."
"When I was kid, I didn't known how to prepare food and that lead me to have diabet. Nowadays, some person think it is important to learn how cooked food and how it is composed. Other argue, that it is not as important as other subject. I think that to teach the science of food can help to save money and to avoid disease. On the other hand, it is important teach them climate change and other topic like biochemistery which are essential.
First of all, it is important to teach in our school how are composed food and how to cook them without spend a lot of money. On reason of that, is because we had spam of advertising around us and, if we did'nt have the good information, we could be more guillible and buy fast food. This misinformation could lead to waste money and poor choice for our health. For example, if you don't know where find carbohydrate, fiber and protein, you will choose the bad food and listen marketing.
In fact, nutrition is not the only subjet which is important, that our time is limited. Moreover, with global warming, our world could encounter a huge challenge during the next century. For instance, climate change and global warming are more important for their education rather than science of nutrition, because they need to be prepared to these big change.
In my point of view, it is important to teach nutrition to our children, because that could lead at an improvement of their health and lifestyle. In contrast, it is not the only issue in the world and they needed to know the fundamental knowledge about the world like chemistery, biology, physic to understand more advanced topics. For example, how can they understand why would needed protein if they didn't understand biochemistery.
To conclude, although, it is a good idea to teach nutrition to our children cause ofthat can help in their life to save money, have a healthy life it is as more as important to give them more primarly knowledge and information more important about the world."
"The line graph illustrates the changes of unemployment rate in 2012, of two different area, urban and rural, in Australia. The most noticeable thing in this graph is rural areas recorded higer unemployment rate than urban areas in all quarters, but in the whole year, the unemployment rate in rural areas decreased while that of urban areas increased.
To be more specific, the unemployment rate of rural areas in Australia largely decreased from 6.5% to 3.5% in the first and the second quarter, while the unemployment rate of urban area rose from 2% to 4%. However, in the beginning of the third quarter, this tendency changed. The unemployment rate of rural areas increased 1% on the third quarter, while it decreased on urban areas by 2%. However, the unemployment rate of urban areas increased after the third quarter. Except the little recession on the end of the third quarter, the percentage has consistently increased and reached to almost 5%. in contrast the unemployment rate in rural areas plateaued from the third quarter, and it remained around 5%.
To sum up, rural areas had higher unemployment rate than urban areas, but while it decreaed 7% to 5%, the unemployment rate of urban areas increased from 2% to 5%, and the difference between the two got tiny at the end of 2012."
"I think students should study about food in schools more frequently. Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.
First of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.
Secondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.
For this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions."
"The given line graph illustrates the unemployment rate in percentage recorded in Australia in 2012. Overall, urban areas have seen an incrementation in unemployed people with a drop in the third quarter of the year. On the other hand, in the rural areas of Australia, during the second quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate significantly reduced and followed by slight fluctuations.
According to the line graph, during the first quarter of the year, urban areas reported an unemployment rate above 2% to double in the second quarter. The rate notably dropped in the third quarter of the year reaching 2% again. In the fourth quarter, unemployed people increased to nearly 5%.
Contrastingly, the Australian rural areas have seen a steady reduction in the unemployment rate, starting from slightly under 7% during the first-year quarter to reaching above the 4% after the second quarter of 2012. Then, the rate fluctuated reaching 5% of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year."
"Some people believe that the science of food and how to make meals should be introduced in schools while others argue that schools should offer only important subjects. I believe that the science of food and how to prepare it should be part of the school subjects as it can bring several benefits in student’s lives. Thus, this essay discusses how creating an understanding of good nutrition, health and well-being it’s important for students to support positive learning and development.
Modern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the students’ choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.
Contrarily, there’s the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.
To sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to students’ learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing."
"The graph illustrates the ratio of unemployment for 2012 in Australia. In general, the unemployment situation in the urban as well as rural areas for four consecutive quarters is demonstrated in the graph.
Firstly, it is observed from this graph that the percentage of the unemployment rate was higher in rural areas than it was in urban areas. For example, the unemployment rate for the people living in rural areas of Australia in 2012 was around 7 percent whereas the residents in the urban areas faced the same crisis by 2%. Besides, the challenge of unemployment was vivid throughout the second and third quarters for both urban and rural areas. However, the situation fluctuated at the end of the fourth quarter when the unemployment ratio reached 5 percent for both areas.
To sum up, though the unemployment ratio faced two different directions in the first quarter for both urban and rural areas, it almost reached an equilibrium point for the fourth quarter."
"A group of people believes that students should learn food science at school whereas other groups perceive the idea of gaining knowledge on necessary subjects. Both types of learning have advantages as well as drawbacks and this essay will highlight both sides of the situation.
The knowledge of food science is admired at some educational institutions where learners are expected to master this art. Students can gain numerous benefits by acquiring knowledge of food at the school level. For example, they become capable of making a career in the food industry or conducting further research on the science of food at the tertiary level. Therefore, some people prioritize gaining expertise in food science from schools.
However, some scholars support the concept of learning only essential subjects for academic and professional purposes. Firstly, it is wiser to learn academic courses that provide enormous career opportunities for the future. For instance, learning subjects such as science, business studies, and sports can open the door to chances for a student. Secondly, the majority of the prestigious jobs in the world are related to technology, economics, and communication. As a result, studying these courses at schools prepares a learner to gain expertise and thrive in the professional sector.
In my opinion, students studying at schools should use their valuable time for learning essential subjects as it helps them succeed in the future. Courses such as food science can be learned at a later stage of life. For example, adult learners are able to join an academic course on food science as many institutions provide face-to-face and online courses in this regard. However, knowledge of subjects such as science, business studies, and arts is inevitable to achieve success in the future. Hence, the potential time of school students should be utilized to learn necessary subjects for a better outcome."
"The line graphs given describe the percentage of unemployment in Australia during 2012 quarterly. In general, there was an opposite trend between the unemployment rate in rural and urban areas that year.
At the beginning of the year, most unemployed lived in rural areas, with more than 6% of their population. On the other hand, the unemployment rate in urban areas was only slightly over 2%. During the first quarter, rural areas' unemployment decreased to less than 6% of the population, while urban areas increased to 3%, which continued until the second quarter, each to 5% and 4%. Furthermore, both rates seemed to fluctuate in the third and fourth quarters until they returned to the same level as in the second quarter. However, after the fourth quarter, the unemployment rate in rural areas tended to stay at a 5% level, while unemployment in urban areas continued to increase to almost the same level as in rural areas.
Eventually, the unemployment gap in rural and urban areas was getting smaller at the end of that period."
"These days, most students learn many school subjects, not only academic topics like math or language but also non-academic, such as science food and how to prepare it. However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters. I believe academic and non-academic subjects should be balanced, and this essay will explain both views.
Human brain development makes our kids learn many things in the early phase. Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.
Nevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.
To conclude, students with a balanced knowledge of academic and non-academic subjects will have a bright future with a healthy and wealthy life."

"The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.
Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.
On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start."
"With diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
In conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects."
"The diagram describes how carbonated drinks are made from raw materials to finished goods before being sent to the market. Overall, there are five stages in the production process of this type of beverage.
At first, the raw water should be cleaned through a filter and blended with a water softener and chemicals before going through to the next stage. After that, it will be driven to the electric heaters and a cooling pipe to evaporate at a certain heat level with additional carbon dioxide.
Furthermore, the water will be sent to the mixing tank, which will be blended with three different materials containing colouring, syrup, and flavour. At the end of the mixing process, the water is already transformed into carbonated drinks, and they will go through the last filter before getting into bottles or cans to be wrapped. Finally, the carbonated drinks are ready to deliver to the supermarket."
"In this digital era, people always use the computer to assist their life, including education programs in school. It is so essential that most schools provide computers in the classrooms for their students. However, if the student is too dependent on computers, it will have two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.
If we go back twenty years, only a few schools already have computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that. In this case, a student who relies so much on computers may need more social skills, as the interaction between student and teacher will be less, that caused by the materials and exercises will be delivered online or by any application programs.
Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students can gain from computers. First, it will provide much positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned and exercises to be done anywhere and anytime. Besides that, a computer will assist the teacher when reviewing the student's homework.
In conclusion, the benefits of computer dependency in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. Eventually, students can study more anywhere and anytime, although there will be a risk related to social concern."
"The given diagram describes how carbonated drinks are made from raw materials to finished goods. As we can see, there are five stages in the production process of carbonated drinks. To begin with, the raw water should be cleaned through a filter and combined with a water softener and chemicals before going through to the next stage. After the water is cleaned, it will go through a pump, and then electric heaters and a cooling pipe to be evaporated at a certain level of heat with additional carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the water will be sent to the mixing tank, which will be blended with three different materials containing coloring, syrup, and flavor. After that mixing process, the water is already transformed into carbonated drinks, and they will go through the last filter before getting into bottles or cans to be wrapped. Finally, the carbonated drinks are ready to deliver to the supermarket."
"In this digital era, we can’t deny that the computer is one of the most critical things in the education program. It is so essential that almost every student has already had it in their home or even on their hand. However, I believe that everything in this world has two impacts, either drawbacks or benefits. In this essay, I will explain my opinion about both sides with relevant examples and experiences.
If we go back to 20 years ago, only a few schools already had computers in their classrooms to support their education programs. Nevertheless, as technology never stops improving, thus the computer itself is getting cheaper every day. Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there always be risks to that. In this case, students may use computers for personal reasons unrelated to the lesson. For instance, they can play a game on the internet or access any prohibited website in the classroom.
Despite the risks, there are also several benefits that students will have from computers. First, it will give them a lot of positive information or knowledge, not only related to Information Technology but also to other matters. For example, schools can provide an e-learning program for any subject, containing materials to be learned in the classrooms and homework to be done by students. Furthermore, it will help not only students but also teachers when reviewing the students’ homework with computers.
After all, the benefits of computers in classrooms sometimes outweigh the drawbacks. However, schools must consider the mitigation of any unrelated use of computers if they want to provide computers in their classrooms."
"This diagram shows each step of the process of making carbonated drinks, the process consists of 5 stages, including packaging.
At the beginning raw water goes through a filtering process, that includes a filter, water softener, and chemicals. After that, the pump pumps the water to the next stage, which is Heating evaporation and carbonation, firstly the water is heated by electric heaters, and secondly goes through a cooling pipe, and after that to a container that injects the carbon dioxide into the water, carbonated water has been formed. After this, the carbonated water transfers to the third stage, at this stage the carbonated drinks are made by a mixing tank, which mixes flavor, syrup, and colouring, after the mix, the carbonated drink will go through the final filter, then the drink will go through the final stage of the process of making carbonated drinks, at this final stage, there are filtering and filling operations will take place, this is usually automated, after the filling and filtering the bottles will be stacked in boxes, for transportation, some drinks require cool temperature through the transportation process and some not. At the end of this process, the carbonated drinks will be on the shelf of the supermarket."
"As the technology is improving, more people are seeing to become reliable to the computers
What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?
Computers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.
In the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.
There is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers.."
"The diagram illustrates how carbonated drinks are made from raw water using different equipments at different stages.
Overall, there are 5 stages involved in the process from using water from houses to packaging the drinks using either bottles or cans for safe consumption. They water is basically transported using pipes.
The first stage involves cleaning the raw water from residential homes using a filter and then adding a water softener and other chemicals to it. The water is then pumped for heating evaporation and carbonation where it is heated using electric heaters, cooled through a cooling pipe and then carbonated in a tank using carbon dioxide.
This carbonated water is then transferred into the mixing tank where it is mixed and colouring,syrup and flavour is added to it at this point. The end product is finally filtered and filled into bottles or cans which is then packaged into boxes and transported for sale in the supermarket."
"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.
Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.
It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.
Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.
In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure."

"The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.
Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.
Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).
Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm."
"Many people know the negative consequences of smoking. However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.
With regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.
In order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.
In conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead."
"This chart depiets the reason why air poullution are faced by some countries which are China , Amarica , Japan and, Australia In the year of 2021. It is clear from the graph that pollution has made by electricity generation , transport and, Industry.
According to what is shown china seems to be the most air pollution country , in comparison to America , Japan, and , Australia. while Australia has the least amount of Air pollution . According to the chinese numbers the industry air pollution reached to 80 PPM and transportion to 70 PPM while the electricity generating reached close to 60 PPM
Moreover, the America has approximatily 60 PPM of Transportation air polluation , while both industry and electricity are near to eachothers of 30 PPM . In addition Japan has strikes of industry more than the other, In mainwhile the pollution rate in Australia is very closed to 20 PPM.
To sum up , we could say that pollution in China could be very danagerous and it can impact other countries over the year."
"Nowadays, Smoking is one of the most destructive unhealthy habit for human had faced since the tobacco invented. so some people think that smoking can help them mentelly and phsicaly and is diffcult stop smoking. While the others believe that smoking can distroy the body slowly and cause the early death. In this essay I will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal opinion.
In one hand , smokers are luch of awareness alternative of stress reduction. Thus most of the smoker believe that smoking is the best solution to releave the stress that they face in their daily lives. For example, nowadays we see many of employees are smoking during their working hours to beat the stress and headache. So that is why some people think that quit smoking is a negative point that can effect them directly .
On the other hand, majority of the smokers must have tried quitting smoking at least once in thier live time. Frankly it is extrmely hard to kick this habit. However, in the 90th some studies shows the facts that all of smokers can get the medical treatment for a while which can leave them to quit smoking forever. This prove clearly that smoking is just a habit.
In conclusion, after carefully analyis of the imprtant points, I believe that the government plays a signaficant factor to help the people, furthermore provide for them all options to stop smoking such as stop selling Nicotine which this is the main ingrediants to causes addiction and damage the body and the brain."
"The bar chart illustrates the amount of three types of air pollution produced by China, America, Japan, and Australia in 2021.
Overall, it can be said that China is responsible for producing the most amount of pollution while Australia emitted the least amount of waste in the air.
According to the chart, China produced just below 60 PPM of pollution by the means of electricity generation which is 2 times higher than the amount of pollution produced by America. 70 PPM of pollution of China is related to transport wastes which is more than 2 times higher than the amount of waste produced by Japan in the same sector. 80 PPM of pollution was produced by the industrial sector of China which is almost 2 times higher than what Japan produced in the same year.
A different trend can be seen in Australia’s pollution levels for 2021. Here pollution produced by each of the three sectors is just below 20 which means that the overall waste production of Australia is more than 3 times lower than the overall waste production of China for the year 2021."
"Although the health related issues caused by smoking are well known to society, smoking is still a popular habit amongst people. This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.
One of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked “cool” and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.
Even though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.
In conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes."
"The chart provides information about air pollution rates and its various culprits in four different countries, namely China, America, Japan, and Australia, during 2021.
Overall, the country with the highest rate of PPM was China, in contrary to Australia with the lowest rate. Roughly, electricity generation seems to be the least common cause of pollution, whilst transportation and pollution from industry seems to have similar levels of PPM.
Japan and China's PPM trend seems alike, with industry ranking the first in PPM level contribution, transportation ranking second, and electricity generation coming third. China's industry, transportation, and electrical generation was roughly 80 PPM, 70 PPM, and 60 PPM respectively, while all of Japan's pollution causes levels are approximately half of China's, with industry contributing a little more than 40PPM, transportation with 30 PPM, and electricity generation with around 15 PPM.
Australia and America, on the other hand, shows no similar patterns to any countries in this chart. America's highest pollution contribution was transporation, with a similar level to that of China's electricity generation, with almost 60 PPM. Transportation and industry's PPM rate in America were alike, with approximately 30 PPM. Meanwhile, all of Australia's sources of pollution's rates were almost the same with 20 PPM, even though electricity generation's PPM level being slightly higher than that of transportation and industry's."
"It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.
Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.
I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.
In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society."
"The bar charts show some different causes of air pollution levels in 4 different countries during the yer of 2021.
First of all, the most striking information is that China appears to be the main country in which pollution is highly present, in the 3 different areas, during the given period. In fact, their levels of pollution ranged between 60 to 80 PPM, and none of the other countries even reached 60 PPM in terms of pollution during 2021.
In 2021, China displayed the highest level of pollution related to electricity generation compared to the other countries. In fact, it was double of America's, as it meant 60 PPM in China. However, although China showed again the highest level of transport pollution with 70 PPM, America was not very far from that figure as it was just under 60 PPM, while Japan was half, and Australia did not even reach 20 PPM.
Finally, industry pollution in China was even bigger than the other areas, as it reached the highest point with 80 PPM. However, even though Japan was largely behind America and China in terms of electricity and transport pollution, it was the second country of indutry pollution, but it was roughly half of China's. America was under that with just under 30 PPM, and Australia displayed even less than that slightly under 20 PPM.
To conclude, China is clearly the country that demonstrated the highest levels of pollution in each given areas, even though America was close to their level of transport pollution at that time. However, despite Japan displayed the second most important level of industry pollution, it remained fairly far from China's, as it was also the case for America and Asutralia."
"Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.
Evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.
However, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.
To conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments."
"The graph illustrates the amount of air pollution from different causes in China, the U.S., Japan, and Australia in 2021. Overall, China had the highest level of air pollution from industrial activity, transport and electricity generation, while Australia had the lowest level of air pollution. The main cause of air pollution in Japan was industry, and that of USA came from transport.
Industrial activity in China produced air pollution the most at 80 PPM, followed by transport at 70 PPM. Electricity generated air pollution the least in the country, but it was still higher than other three countries (just below 60 PPM). However, Australia, generated air pollution from the three activities at just below 20 PPM.
America produced air pollution from transport (at just under 60 PPM), followed by electricity generation (at just over 30 PPM), and industry at just under 30 PPM. Japan's air pollution came from industrial activities (at above 40 PPM), followed by transport, which was at 30 PPM, and electricity at 15 PPM."
"Many people smoke although they know how harmful smoking is. This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation."

"The bar graph illustrates four countries' air pollution levels caused by three different factors - electricity generation, transport, and industry - in 2021.
Overall, there are two features; while China suffered most severely from all three elements, Australia had the least air pollution.
To be more specific, Chinese air pollution was by far the worst in 2021. Among the three factors, industry pollution hit as much as 80 PPM, which was nearly two times as large as that in Japan. China's air pollution caused by electricity generation is the smallest among the three factors in China. Nevertheless, it was almost 60 PPM and approximately double that in the United States of America.
On the other hand, Australia had the least amount of air pollution in total in 2021. The three elements of air pollution are almost the same - slightly less than 20 PPM. Among them, only electricity generation in Australia surpassed that in another country - Japan."
"Although it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.
First of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.
Secondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.
There are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax."
"The bar chart indicates the amount of Olympic medals obtained by twelve different countries. Overall, it is clear that the USA won much higher medals than the other countries. In addition, Soviet Union follows as the second-highest number of medals and much higher than the third country, the UK. In contrast, there is significant different in total number of medals from he t4th largest number of country, Germany to the lowest number of country, Japan.
The USA got extraordinary high number of medal than the other countries. It is approximately 2,300. In addition, all types of the medal, gold, silver, bronze, remarkably higher than the other countries. For example, even gold medals are close to 1000 in total and this means that it is higher than the third highest country, the UK. The UK is approximately 700 hundred medals, including gold, silver, and bronze. 4th
Another notable feature is the fourth largest country, Germany obtained around 500 medals, but other countries had close number campared with all countries. Even the lowest country, Japan also got close to 350 medadals. Therefore, other 8 countries got totally similar numbers and no significant change."
"The topic of whether children should not do homework after school or definitely important to do homework plays a key role in the education of children. Although
there are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.
Initially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.
On the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class
everyday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.
Finally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.
homework is necessary for children more than anything."
"The chart below shows the total number of Olympic medals won by twelve different countries. Ranging from 0 medals to 2500 medals.
Overall, the USA has the most medals, with a total of nearly 2500 medals. And on the other hand, Japan has the least number of medals, with about 300 medals, almost 4 times less than the USA. There's only five other countries which have another 500 medals, being the Soviet Union with 1000 medals, the UK with 750 medals, France with around 600 medals, Germany and Italy with slightly over 500 medals. While Sweden, Australia, Hungary, East Germany, Japan and China are all under 200 medals total.
The USA dominated in all types of medals, with nearly 1000 gold medals. over 500 silver medals and bronze medals. The Soviet Union came in second with almost 500 gold medals, and over 500 bronze and silver medals combined.
After the Soviet Union, the next four countries have an average of 250 gold medals, 350 silver medals and bronze medals combined. The last six countries have an average of 200 gold medals, 250 silver medals and bronze medals combined. Japan has the least gold medals and silver medals and China has the least bronze medals.

"Should Homework be given to students. Many said ""yes"" and many said ""no"". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let's compare them wisely.
On the ""homework is bad for students” side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.
On the other hand, ""homework is good for students'' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.
If students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.
So I agreed that homework is good for you, as long as it is optimized and isn't time consuming. If teachers are abusing it, then it will became a good way to torture students."
"The chart gives information about how many medals (gold, silver and bronze) have been won by twelve different countries during the Olympic.
On the whole, USA succeed by large over the other eleven country in winning medals, either gold, silver or bronze. Sovet Union arrived second in obteining the highest amount of medals, followed by UK and France. All the rest of eight countries won more or less a similar number of Olympic medals.
In terms of gold Olympic medals, Usa reached the highest peak at almost 1000 medals, second placement is occupied by Sovet Union with roughly 400 medals, whilst the other ten countries got a similiar amount of it. Likewise silver Olympic medals, USA at the first place with more then 500 medals won, followed by Sovietic Union, UK and France. With regards of bronze medal, Usa still leading the chart.
On the other side, the country with less vittory, therefore a minimum number of medal won, was Japan. Even tho China and East Germany did not get far from Japan with only few more gold medals won rather then bronze or silver."
"Nowadays people's opinion regarding homework for school children is that it should not be given, on the other hand some people are not agreeing. In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.
Personally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.
From my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.
Having said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.
To conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, homework should be given in order to allow student to understand how to flourish indipendently, but simultaneously, the amount of homework load should be re-evaluated."
"The chart compares the number of medals won by 12 countries in Olympics. In brief, USA won the biggest amount of medalls overall and in each category followed by Soviet Union and UK. The difference between USA and Soviet Union is much bigger than between Soviet Union and UK, more than 2000 medals for USA, 1000 for Soviet Union and more than 500 for UK. France, Germany and Italy also passed the freshhold of 500 medals, closely followed by Sweden and Hungary with less than 500 medals. Australia follows Sweden with the same amount of silver and bronze medals but fewer gold. East Geramny has the same amount of gold medals, but fewer amount of silver and bronze than Hungary. The smallest amount of medals was won by Japan and China. The major trend for all the countries is that all types of medals: gold, silver and bronze are close to being proportionate to one another."
"Due to the importance of education there is always a debate on how best to teach. The biggest discussion point is homework. Even though it sometimes can apply too much pressure on the students, it helps process the materials better and prepares students for adult life.
One of the main drawback of homework is the amount of time and effort it usually requiers. In a lot of schools homework takes at least several hours to do which can be a lot after a long school day. Another issue with homework are the mark that students get because the can affect a mental health of a developing child a lot.
However, homework can help students work on their skills and give a deeper understanding of the subject in question. Homework can be very helpful when a student is sick or absent in the class to process all the materials at home. It is also very common situation when a struggling student raised his marks by doing homework which improved his skills in a long run.
Personally, I think homework is essential part of schooling. It teaches you responsibility, for example by meeting your deadlines, and helps process knowledge that you gained in class. In addition, homework teaches teenagers to learn which is the most important skill everyone should gain at school.
Thus, even though homework can sometimes take a lot of time and don't give a desired mark in return, it prepares students for an adult tasks such as projects at work and strict deadlines."

"The graph describes the amount of medals earned by several countries during the Olympic games. Overall, it is evident that one country has won many more medals than the remaining nations. Additionally, 9 out of 12 countries are European countries.
The United States is the leading nation, accumulating around 2.400 medals. Among this number, the figure shows that the country has earned almost 1000 gold medals, followed by 600 silver medals, and 500 bronze medals. The second country presented in the graph is the Soviet Union, although it is not clear if the aforementioned nation also includes medals won by Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee. In sum, the Soviet Union accumulates a total number of 1000 medals, 400 of which are gold medals, followed by 250 silver and bronze medals.
The remaining countries of the graph are still far from the United States and the Soviet Union. Together, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany add up a total number of 1800 medals. Let's bear in mind that only the United States has earned a greater number of medals than these three countries together."
"Nowadays, schools around the world are exploring new pedagogical methodologies. Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support children´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.
Having homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.
On the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.
To conclude, homework-based schools have more advantages for children than homework-free schools. Therefore, homeworks are still an important tool to improve the learning experience of children around the world."
"This diagram shows the life cycle of the honey bee. it is clear from what is shown that honey bee has a life cycle less than 36 days.
it is look that the bee females lay between one or two eggs every three days, then the eggs is going to hatch after nine to ten nights. after the 10 days passed and the eggs hatched, you will see such a beautiful tiny bee, it will grow as well as her mother when she was in her age, the little bee is going to take just a five days to be bigger in a noticed way. then it will be larger and larger and all that in a extremlley short period, when the little bee become 9 days it will be like a young anough like a human tenager, after only 4 days from that it will be ready for be mother or a father, or should we say it will be ready for a marrige :)
to sum up we most say that the bee have a very short life periods, and it is grow easly."
"These days many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal, while on the other hand, there is some people think that other typs of progress like military, envirement,education..etc, are equally important for a country.
Before we start discuss both these views. we have to know the meaning of the economic, you dear reader might know the general meaning but do you have any idea about what is the deep meaning of the economic. lets take a short tour.
When someone says ""economic"" he often means any thing realted to money, banks, industries, big companies, anything that making money its under economic, even when you are a tourist in somewhere in whole world you making the economic in the country that you live in for a few days go up.
Goverements argue that economic is very important than other for a list of reasons, lets know about some of them.
- They think if everything is related to economy then it most be more important than anything els.
- As the economy is almost ruling everything. so if they focous on the country's economy any other problem will be solved directly.
Now we know governments opinion, shall we beagan to look at the oposite view?
- People who take the other side, think that when the government works only on the economy, the education and the other important things will be going down.
- when the other thing going down the economy will not be survaivd either.
Over all the, and to show you my own view. i think government should work on economy and the other in equal way."
"The diagram illustrates the life cycle of the honey bee.
In essence, a honey bee's life cycle takes roughly seven weeks. Regarding to the diagram, is composed of only 6 diferent images, even thought, it describes with detail all different stages of a bees life cycle: from its birth until it reaches maturity.
Beginning with the cycle, it starts when the bee larvae rests inside and egg, which will probably be attached to a wall inside the honneycomb. 10 days later, eggs will hatch and a baby bee will sprang out. Within the next 21 days, the bee will grow in size. It is remarkable the fact that nymphs moult 3 times as they grow. After a month of growth, the bee will become a young adult. Finally, bees are consider mature, four days after they reach adulthood. As for reproduction, female bees lay 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days."
"The economic progress ought to be a concern for a goverment. The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.
Firstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.
Secondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.
All things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed. From my point of view, governments shoud give economic progress less importance and attend other matters such as education or social aids. If they create a real change with their decisions, economic progress will eventually be achieved."
"Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.
The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.
Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs."
"There is an ongoing debate about wether a government economic progress is far more important than any other type of progress, for instance: social, technological or health advancements. Although this perspectives are both valid, I believe that authorities do not have to value economy over everything else because it leads to overlooking the basic needs of society.
On the one hand, prioritizing economic progress is important because it is the basis that sustains every countries' needs. Without a strong economy, governments would not be able to afford education or health. For instance many studies show that wealthier countries tend to give their citizens a better life quality.
On the other hand, other types of progress such as educational, technological and health developements can lead to better outcomes in society. For instance it has been proven that countries with the best quality of education tend to be more peaceful and have less crime rates than those where education is not a priority.
In my opinion education, health and technological progress when available to evryone can lead to better developement not only financial but also in the equality of opportunies which is the key to much more content and peaceful societies. Governments that value economy over everything else tend to forget that the true value relies on the people and their needs, not in making money. Economy progress is part of a developed society but should not rely at the centre of issues because well being and good quality of life is a complex goal that requires success in many areas of society."

"The diagram provided depicts a multistep process on the complete growth and maturation of the honey bee.
Overall, the lifecycle occurs over a five step repeating series, starting with the mating of the male and female honey bee and finalising once the honey bee as fully matured into an adult. This cycle lasts a total period of 34-36 days.
In the inital stage, the male and female honey bee mate with one another. Once inpregnated, the maternal bee lays around 1 to 2 eggs on a flat surface. This process takes place after a period of three days and is repeated as such on each third day. Next, the layed eggs hatch once they've reached their 9th or 10th day of life, giving rise to the newly born nymph. The nymph then moults three times during it's growth and development, at days 5, 7 and 9 respectively, until it has matured into a young adult. Over the next 4 days, this young adult honey bee further matures until finally developing into a fully grown adult. The cycle then repeats once the now fully developed adult male or female once more undergoes intercourse with it's counterpart."
"Since the industrial revolution, our economy has continued to expand and develop at an impressive increasing rate. Hence, many goverments worldwide believe that their primary objective is to focus on the development of goods and services. Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.
Firstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.
However, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.
To conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come."
"The presented diagram describes the operation of a heated balloon. At first glance, it is evident that a hot balloon contains three major components, including a basket, a burner, and an envelope system.
A basket is an appropriate spot where individuals stand beneath a hot balloon. Besides, a burner is a piston situated on top of the basket. It combines propane and air to generate flame and heated air. The rope connects the burner and skirt, and it allows the envelope system to be linked with the bottom portion.
The vertical lines on the balloon itself are referred to as gores, whereas the horizontal lines are defined as panels. A self-sealing flap is labelled as a parachute valve in which located on the top of the balloon, enabling hot air to flow out at a consistent rate.
In other words, if hot air is lighter than cool air, it would rise when the burner produces a flame. Hence, the hot balloon would employ this power to take off."
"There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.
To begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.
Apart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.
In light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies."
"The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.
In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.
Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.
Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky."
"Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.
To start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.
Having said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.
To sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out."
"The given picture describes how a hot balloon functions.
Overall, it is clearly seen that for this to work, we would need a balloon which has several parts and air (converted from cool to hot when it mixes propane).
First of all, the balloon is divided into an envelope, a skirt and a basket. The envelope has three parts, a parachute valve, which has its own sealing flap that allows the exit of the hot air at a controlled proportion, then the gores and panels. This part sits on a band called the skirt. The basket contains the burner and a propane cylinder, which mix propane with air to make a flame that gives out hot air. The basket is attched to the skirt by a rope. This air is lighter than cool air, so when it flows through the envelope, it makes the ballon light and flows easily, while the cool air which is heavier helps the brings the balloon down from the atmoshpere to land."
"Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.
First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.
Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.
In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems."
"In this essay we will show how the industry of digital games has changed between 2000 and 2006.
It's important to say that in 2000 the majors player es in the industrie were console games and handheld games. Console games represented 6 billion industry and the handheld games represented an alomost 12 billion dollar industry.
It's important to mentioned than in 2001 a new competidor show up it was the online games that only represented an estimated 1 billion dollar of the digital game industry's.
After the apperence of the online game a new player emerged it was the Mobil phone games that in the first year achieved the same revenue than the online game's. I think that its important to say that the affected one because the new competitors were the console games having a reduction on those years of almost 2 billion dolars.
Meanwhile the handheld Games were gaining a potential grow of their revenue by having and increased from almost 11 billion in 2011 to 18 billion dolars in 2006.
The others competitors where having a growth more control and very even but in 2006, the online games reported a 8.5 billion dólares revenu meanwhile the Mobil phone reported almost 7 and console games almost 4.
It's important to see that the real competition is between online games and Mobil games."
"Taking about bullying its more important every day. I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.
I think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.
Continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
Also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
Like ones president Benito Juárez said ""The respect to the right of others is the peace"".
When i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
So also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.
These could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it."
"The diagram illustrates the production of electricity for domestic use by solar panels. Overall, electricity is provided after it has been processed using 5 equipments ( solar panels, inverter electrical panel, utility meter and utility grid).
First of all, solar panels on the roof of a normal house receive and absorb energy from the sun and turn it into DC current. The second stage is that, the DC current is converted into AC current by using inverter, which controls the electricity and production. After that, once the solar electricity has been distributed to our homes, it is then flowed back to the grid through a utility meter.
At the final stage of the process, a utility grid, which looks like a small electrical tower, provides electricity when an user uses extra amount than the amount produced by the solar panles. By these stages, electricity is produced and ready for domestic use."
"In this contemporary era, some people give time to their hobbies. From my point of view, they are doing this because of the benefits accrued from the importance of practising hobbies. For example, people who give time to their hobbies feel less stress from who do not. Another reason why practising hobbies a day in a week is vital for some people, because they want to change their daily routine of work and stressful life.
Hobbies have positive effects on a person. It is vital for his/her mental and pshycal health
by keeping their mind refreshed and maintaining balance of their well-being. For instance, doing a hobby like football or other kinetic hobbies has a significant impact on person's stamina. Furthermore, it is a good chance to move his muscle and prevent premature aging in many individuals.
The crucial influences of allocating time to hobbies that we can see on society are the importance of them in improving the family life which consquently will enhance the social life and the society. There are a lot of social hobbies like going to the cinema or travelling which a family can take a part in it and that will make an excellent environment between a father and his childreen and his wife as well.
As we have seen, allocate time to hobbies has a significant impact on the individual and the society which could help all concerned to emphasis on this feature to develop their abilities and alleviate the side effects of this stressful life."
"The diagram demonstrates how solar panels generate electricity for domestic use. Overall, the system comprises of 5 main parts, each with their own functions.
The solar panels set on the roof undertake the most important task, energy transformation. They receive heat radiated from the sun and transform it to electricity, of which the form is DC current. Then an inverter will turn the DC current into AC current, controlling the production of electricity meanwhile. The electrical panel serves as the distributor transferring the electricity to the user's house.
Utility meter is an amazing device which is able to have any excess electricity flow back to the grid through the meter. It is very considerate of the designer of the system, that they invented the utility grid, which serve as an important supplement to the solar panels, ensuring adequate electricity would be provided even once you use too much electricity that exceed the provision by the solar panels."
"Nowadays it seems that few people are willing to dedicate time to hobbies and pastimes. This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.
First, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.
Also, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.
These phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find ""Pride and Prejudice"" unfamiliar, and ""Romeo and Juliet"" alien to them.
People losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.
To sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy."
"The diagram below illustrates the way of solar panels work to produce the electricity for domestic use. It is clear from the diagram how to convert the heat which people do not like usually to something very useful to them as electricity.
There are many ways to designed solar panel array depend on direction of sunlight and should place in a wide area with face the sun rays most time of the morning, so the panel could collect the big amount of sun rays to convert to DC current. Then, the DC will pass during the inverter, which this device able to converts the DC to AC current, because this type of current more safety for human use, after that the controller can control the electricity and production.
Third step, the current feed the electricity panel as the unit needs and any excess solar electricity will feedback the grid through the utility meter. Which the grid also can provide the necessary electricity when the unit needs exceed the amount produced by the solar panel."
"There is denying the fact that the main purpose of hobbies is arguable. The truth is that avocation used to be a vital part of every individual's life routine but the question is why most people become do not spend their time doing their hobbies and what the effect of it on the individual and society.
While it is held belief that the avocation is needed time, but lifestyle become different for many people these days,they feel should be working almost of their time to can provide the primary needs for themselves or for children, because everything become expensive. So They spend most of their energy during work by the site for a long period in their office , so after they back home just need to relax and sleep.
On one hand, The most important one is the invasion of technology in our lives. Most people spend hours on cell phones, chatting, online shopping and generally surfing various websites such as Twitter and Fakebook. eat away most of the precious time that can be spent doing some healthy activity.
Therefore, it is having an adverse effect on the individual and society. The health problem increased a few years ago , especially heart diseases, diabetes and depression, community have become more distant from each other , and lack of feel peace in most of the people .
In conclusion , avocation is a healthy source to make the public more creative and have good health , where they can lose a lot of stress and develop their skills in a different field , away from work or other routine problems. But quite doing that led to many issues that the people found difficult to deal with it."
"The diagram shown gives a pictorial view of the process of electricity generation via solar panels for domestic use. The energy is transferred through 5 major points, as shown by the diagram.
Overall, the process starts with energy absorption from the sun. The subsequent stages are followed to generate and distribute electricity in the household, with the last stage being the storage and reuse of stored electricity by the utility grid.
Firstly, the solar panels which have been placed at appropriate locations for receiving sunlight absorb the sun's energy. This energy is converted to DC current, which is in turn converted to AC current by the inverter. This inverter is responsible for production and electricity control.
Afterwards the electricity is transferred to the electrical panel which distributes the acquired electricity throughout the home for use. Not all of the electricity is put into use and this excess is sent through the utility meter to the utility grid for storage. In the event that the household consumption exceeds the amount produced by the solar panel, the utility grid provides electricity through the utility meter to meet the deficit."
"Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.
Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.
Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.
Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.
This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.
In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place."

"The diagram illustrates the way how solar energy can be used as a source of household energy. Overall, the process consists of 5 stages, which implies the use of different devices, namely solar panels, the inverter, the electrical panel, the utility meter and the utility grid. The construction needs the sunlight to be converted into energy afterwards.
First of all, solar panels on the roof of the house absorb the sun energy and transform it into DC current. Next, the DC current is converted into the AC current by going through an inverter, which can also be used as the generated electricity controller.
It is important to note that the electrical panel is used in several ways. First, it distributes the electricity to your home. Second, it is connected to the utility meter that flows back extra solar energy to the grid. Last but not least, if the amount of sunshine is not enough to supply the house with electricity, the utility grid, that is also wired to the panel, provides it in the usual way."
"Nowadays everyone is suffering from the lack of time. People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.
Needless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.
On the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.
To sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and “tendency to be depressed” of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots."
"The given diagrams provide an illustration of a modern landfill for household wastes. Overall, a typical landfill is a man-made hole dug on a solid, two-layer base in which household refuse is kept and toxic liquids are removed from the landfill by the use of a system of pipes.
The construction of a landfill commences when a large hole is dug out of a site with natural rock underneath. The bottom of the hole is thereafter covered with a layer of clay and another layer of unspecified synthetic substance. A drainage tank which is a box-shaped compartment dug through the two aforementioned layers and a set of drainage pipes are also installed.
When used, the landfill is filled up with household waste, with the leachate being extracted and eventually flowing out of the site in liners. Once the rubbish has been converted into a mud-like compound, the landfill is sealed with clay, and gases that are emitted as a result of the conversion is eventually pumped out to an unspecified zone"
"It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldn’t be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.
It is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.
Nevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage can’t be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.
To sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety."
"These illustration graphs explain the process of how a modern landfill for domestic waste is created.
There are three sective of entire process, including construction, which could be divided into two steps, followed by the section of the use and the final part which is the closure.
Start with the construction by createing an artificial deep hole, which surrounded by the natural rocks. Pilling up the hole with synthetic substance and clay ,respectively, before instal the drainage tank and grainage pipes. Four drainage pipes are settled parallelly and all connected with a main pipe reach out the hole.
After the preparation is completed, it comse with the official use. Set the domestic trash inside the hole, which allows the waste liguid draning in the ground through the clay. The last part is closure, which the holw will be coved with clay, which the gases produced along the process will be outputted through the pipes connect to outer place."
"The modern technology enable the spread of the information around the world, which contribute vast benefits in variaty fields, professional aspect included. However, the scepticles hold a persisimistic attitude toward such phenomenons. In my perspective, the exchange of information is very crucial to provoke the progress in the schooler field. The wrongful usage of valuable data, on the other hand, should be carefully abserved by authorities.
On the bright side, be able to access information around the world allowing specialists enlarge the data pool. As analysits in economic professional area, the disparity of background in the statistic allows them provide a more accurate prediction.
The opponents who agains widely sharing the professional datas seeing this in a different angle. The easy access of information could means that the lack of censorship, which makes those professional information less reliable. It could led to a great bias conclusion regarding the researchs and statistics done base on such information. Many well known newspapers which alledged for delivering default message are due to refer the unreliable resource from internet.
In conclusion, it is inevitebly that the ability of exchange valuable information are essential to derive vast of benefits in professional world and provoke the developing of human society in variaty of aspects, such as science, economic, and other professional area. However, it is also very crucial for the correlative authorities to came out a series of countermeasures to varify the reliability of those resources in the cyber world."
"The plans illustrate how a building that houses students was in 2010 and at the moment.
Overall, the number of student bedrooms has increased compared to 2010.The main entrance and hallway have not been changed neither has the kichen(also currently serves as a social area for the students) or bathroom.The living room was permanently removed.
In 2010,the garden on the far left of the building was infront of the lounge room and one bedroom, it extended to the left of the living room and the right side of the hall which is nolonger the case. At the moment, the left side of the building has three sleeping rooms overlooking the garden. The sitting room and small lush area that used to be on its left have been transformed to single bedrooms.
Whereas the main entrance used to lead to a single sleeping room,it now faces an ensuite bedroom with a parking area on the right of the hallway where previously was a garden."
"The essay below is a discussion on a common topic that arises often between people who live in big cities and those who stay in rural areas or rather small towns. Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?
Firstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.
Traffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.
However, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.
In my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that? We have people in the less populated areas who are unwell or obese while we have those living in big towns and are in great physical and mental shape."
"The table illustrates the difference of wasting problem in six developed countries between 1980 and 2000. By and large, it is clear that the production was increased in a majority of countries, which US had the largest production during these periods of times. However, the number of waste production was decreased in Korea in these 20 years.
Looking the table more closely, one can see that the US maintained the hugest waste production in these 20 years. It was followed by Japan, constituting the US stood at 192(in millions of tonnes) which was more that nearly triple than Japan where was just at 53 (in millions of tonnes) in 2000. Meanwhile, Ireland as well as Portugal maintained the lowest waste production in these periods of times, representing Ireland's waste production was as same as Portugal which were 5 (in millions of tonnes) in 2000.
On contrast, it is apparently to see that Korea was an only country where the number of waste production was declined from 1980 to 2000, consisting of Korea had 31 (in millions of tonnes) in 1990 which similar to Japan's 32 (in millions of tonnes) of waste production, having said that, it was fell to 19 (in millions of tonnes) in 2000."
"Nowadays, with different advanced technologies development, it is common to see that people can search on a range of information online. Perhaps some people believe that there are more transparent in distinct research and information. However, some critics concern about some imformation not being shared freely as well. This eassy will discuss both these viewpoints in the following paragraphs.
First of all, people tend to the more information the internet has, the more benefit the users get. This means that people will become more proficient in their majors and works due to gaining a lot of relevant resources online in different areas. A case in point is different professional like managers, doctors, teachers and lawers can require a wider range of references to complete and reach their working goals as well as improve the workplace situation. Hence, it is highly likely to see that it may good to share as much information as possible online.
Conversely, some critis argue that if every information shared freely, it would harmful to academic development such as intellectual property. This is to say that when people missused these kinds of information, there would occur plagiarism much more easily. A good illustration to my point is some university students would copy different resources to their eassies in order to get a higher sorce or avoid some complicated experiments. Even some companies will copy another products design from their opponents. Therefore, it is possibly to say that in bid to protect their intellectual property, some information must not have shared by free.
To summarise, it is hard to say that which sides of opinion is the best. But even so, in my point of veiw, the key is moderation. What means by this is when people want to share their opinions as well as reseachs online, they should make an informed decision for sharing it freely or not.

"The table below compares the amount of waste production in millions of tones by six countries in 1980, 1990 and 2000. Overall, it is clear that in United States produce the most amount of waste production over a twenty- year period. Korea is the only country where the refuse amount had decrease for the last twenty years, while rest of the countries' (Ireland, Japan, Poland, Portugal and US ) waste had increase year by year.
According to the graph, US had 131 millions of tons waste in 1980 and ended at 192 millons of tons in 2000. The second most amount of waste production is in Japan where started with 28 and 32 millions of tons in 1980 and 1990. In 1990, the amount was followed by Korea with 31 millions of tons, but this country had decreased by 12 millions of tons while Japan had increased by 21 millions tons.
Poland and Portugal seen the similar size of waste amount each year. Both countries increased from 1.5 times to 2.5 times. Ireland dis not have refuse figure in 1990. The country had only 0.6 millions of tons in 1980 and after 40 years, it reached at 5 millions of tons."
"In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.
By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.
On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.
To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources."
"The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.
To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.
Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot."
"In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.
To begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.
On the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.
In conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online."
"The graph depicts how many of leisure time men and women of different employment status enjoy in a week.
Generally, the graph shows that the number of hours of leisure time enjoyed by men is higher than that of women. Additionally, it can be seen that unemployed and retired people have more leisure time compared to the others.
People who are unemployed and retired have more leisure time than people with other employment status. For the these two cases, the number of hours of leisure time enjoyed by men is about 90 hours per week, which is slightly higher than that of women who have about 70 hours of leisure time per week.
Regarding the people who are employed full time, men and women respectively have about 50 and 40 hours of leisure time per week. Women who are employed part time have about 40 hours of leisure time per week. Meanwhile, the corresponding figure for women who are housewives is around 50 hours."
"These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.
The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks
and even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.
For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.
In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements."
"The given diagram demonstrates the changes in global sales of the top five mobile phone brands durin the period from 2009 to 2013.
It is clearly seen that 3 out of 5 companies have significant growth, whilst two other companies lost their positions in market sales.
The biggest progress during the period was made by Apple, which sales indicator in 2013 shows almost 6 times bigger amount of selled mobile phones comparing to 2009, and equal to 150 million. The Nokia company shows the most significant regress, the number of mobile phones rapidly decreased from 2011 and equal to 250 in 2013, nevertheless it is second the most popular brand after Samsung which selled 450 million phones in 2013. Also, there are 2 more companies which are competing in mobile phone market, with sale indicators are above 50 for both.
It is worth to notice that the biggest seller in 2013 have selled almost equal number of phones that 2 next companies in the top-5"
"Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.
On the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.
On the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?
The main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.
To sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits"
"The chart depicts the global sales figure of the top five mobile phone companies from 2009 to 2013. Overall, it can be seen that three companies, Samsung, Apple, And ZTE increased their sales, while two companies, Nokia and LG feld down their sale.
Initially, Nokia used to be the highest sales of the other companies in 2009. It was specially close to 450 and it doubled to the second-highest sales Samsung. Then the sales figure slightly dwindled to approximately 400 in 2011, but they kept the highest sales figure. But the sales figure suddenly plummeted to 250 and resulted in the second highest sales among five companies in 2013. LG is also slightly kept reducing the sales figure and slightly dropped the sales. It was more than 100 in 2009, and hit the lowest point of around 70 in 2013.
Another notable feature is that Samsung started their sales figure around 200 in 2009, and kept boosting sales steadily. As a result, Samsung reached a peak of sales 450 and the highest sales around the world in 2013. A similar phenomenon occurred at Apple. Apple used to be the worst sales in 2009. It was far less than 50. Then the sales drastically surge to nearly 100 in 2011, and Apple also had the highest sales figure in 2013. It was 150 and this was the third highest sales of five companies."
"The topic of some people are fond of spending their lives with doing ordinary tasks every day. And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.
It is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.
On the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.
Finally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.
In conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes. As a result, people will get used to this pace and be more creative."
"The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.
In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.
The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year."
"Some people prefers living in a stable condidtion. They were doing almost the same routine every day, going to the same bookshop or gorceries on weekend and same things to do at work. There are not much changes in their lives. Others like to living in the changing environment. They keep trying new things, go to the different restrauants or meeting new friends. Sometimes they even challenging themselves by moving to other positions at work.
I agree with both views because these two views are not conflict. One can meeting new friends in the same coffee store or can meeting old friends in different coffee sotres. The change and unchange only represent some parts of their lives. Like the aforementioned example, one can go to the same gorcery shop every weekend but go out with different friends at Saturday night. Or one can go to different cafes but to have the same order of coffee.
The change and unchage are exist in each other. The world is changing all the time that no one can walking in the same street twice. This is a philosephy saying. Because as time flows the stree that you stepped on was no longer the same street, the leaves may change or the tree may changeBut if that is the same path you walk to company every day, it is the same street in your plan. That means the street is relatively changed/unchaged. On one can stop the world changing, and what can be unchange is ourself, or our minds. We can have the same mindset everyday in different environments."
"This bar chart illustrates the global sales of the top five mobile phone brands during the period from 2009 until 2013. It is clear from the graph that the largest market share is split between Nokia and Samsung, and the rest percentage distributed over the other corporates.
According to what is shown, over the selected period, Nokia and Samsung had the advantage in the market, but the distinguish between this too brands was the changes on there states over the years, Samsung had doubled its share, which was in approximately 225 in 2009 by end of 2013 its achieved 450, in the other part were Nokia had decrease its share from 450 to 250. to demonstrate, we have an accelerates group which they had increase they accusation more market share like Apple and ZTE comparing the other group which loss the advantage over the years. to sum up, in terms of market behavior, that are normal to see brands had developed there prodects and got new segment, and the traditional brands which they don’t develop."
"There is no doubt that this approach in life gives those people a stable feeling, when they stay in the same position for a long period they feel comfortable because they will avoid any issues. In this article I am going to demonstrate the reasons behind why people prefer to eliminate any chance to change.
To illustrate, I belive that there are too kinds of people, the kind which they prefer to change freqentily to try new things or to improve their life or to develop any shortage things they relies that they have to change. In the other side we have the people which feels more peaceful when they avoid any changes more then when they add any things new to there life. In addition, this group of people have another reasons that explain why they did not attind to change, the reasons about the space which they get from the stability, the new things make them feel more confuse.
In conclusion, there are many approaches to live in this planet, in my opinion the people which have more interest to try new things they have the ability to think in critivty way and see the details in any thing they will face also they have the fast dicison skills comparing the other people because they try new things constant and have the confidant etheir. while the conservative people have no flexibility to make fast decision or to think by using new tools, but the advantage for them are they look like have more wise thinking."
"The diagram gives information about worldwise sales of the best cell phone brands, such as Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE in 2009, 2011 and 2013.
In short, three brands show an upwards trend over the period, whilst Nokia and LG sale decline.
On one side, Samsung, Apple and ZTE sales went up during the four years, even though only the first brand increase drastically peaking at 450 sales in 2013. This marked an increment of 225 sales from 2009. However, Apple rose was significant too (from 25 sales in 2009 to 150 in 2013). ZTE sales were marginally increased.
On the other side, Nokia sales dammatically plummeted to 250 in 2013, whereas LG sales steadly dropped from 120 in 2009 to 75 in 2013. Nokia was leader in the market in 2009 and 2011, but the Chinese company earn the spot in 2013 reaching the highest peak of sales ever reached during this four years (450)"
"Change is considered a positive thing by some people, whilst other would rather have the same routine avoinding any different activities. Hence, it is complicated to agree or disagree with one of these way of thinking, the choice is personal. However, trying something outside of the normal routine could bring improvement in lifes.
Change is an important topic in our modern world where everything moves and evolves so quickly and people do not have the time to reflect on the present. Therefore, it is understanding if someone is afraid of it and prefer to have the same habits, spending their life doing the exact same circle of thing week after week. This is call comfort-zone. Everyone aims at it at some point of their life because it is reassuring, easy and releaxing. But does it brings in people's life important events or news? The answer most likely is no. If people do not go out of their comfort-zone, choosing changes over habits, they will never experience something new. In the long run people become unsatisfied, depressed holding negative thoughts and unhappy.
On the other side, changes are bringing new scenario in mankind's life that can improve, most of the time, their situation. For instance, when a human-being is frustrated by his/hers job, he/she should try to get a new one. Best case scenario he/she will feel more appriciated by it. The point is that this person has not lost anything by this change, because he/she still have an employment. I strongly believe that changes is a good thing because the way people feel during the process of changing is exciting.
to sum up, Every mankind should live without regret, the change might not bring an effectively positive metamorphosis, but there is still somenthing to lear out of it."

"The pictures give information about two ways of protecting houses from flooding. Overall, the houses or buildings are constructed on stamps.
The first way of protecting buildings from floods it to make them far away from the water and not to close to the hill or mountain to avoid any water coming down. Additionally, the stopbank should be place close to the water as a protection wall. At the bottom of the stopbank a floodgate is allocated so that water can pass to the internal pond underneath the house without touching it and a bem is situated to the water side which can open and close depending on the water level.
The second diagram does not have a stopbank and the house is positioned closer to the water. The house is built on higher stamps, so that the water can flow underneath it. Between house and water, a freeboard of around 300mm can be found where no water should be, so that the house remains dry."
"In the past, couples moved together after getting married, there was no other choice. Nowadays, living together before deciding to get married, is a common trend specially by young couples. I strongly agree that sharing a life before heading to the next level of a relationship, is a positive way to get to learn each other better.
First and foremost, by living together the couple will learn some of the bad habit the other one has such as brushing the teeth in the kitchen sink, leave the dishes in the sink for another time to clean them and more. It is important, that the person is aware of such behaviour, so when they get married, it is not a surprise. Additionally, the individual has enough time to deal with it or to make a negative decision. Moreover, they can talk about it and look together for solutions.
By living together the individuals share the bills and other invoices. Thus, they will find out if the other one is reliable and able to pay the bills on time. There is enough evidence, that the finances are a challenge in many relationships. You want to make sure that the bills are paid on time. In many relationships, the individuals share a bank account specifically to pay invoices, trust a priority, indeed. For example, you do not want to need to pay for your expenses and the bank account is emptied by your partner.
On the other hand, in many conservative cultures and societies, people can only move together after marriage. The individuals do not know whom they will be sharing their lives. Thus, much has to be learnt and accepted due to the fact, that getting divorced is not accepted.
To sum up, living together before getting married has a myriad of advantages. Thus, I am of the view, that it is beneficial to live together and get to learn each other well before taking the next step."
"The diagrams show the way in which the flooding of houses may be prevented by constructing them upon raised foundations, so that the floor of the house is separated from the highest probable water level (considering a period of 100 years) by at least 300 millimeters (30 centimeters). This distance is called ""freeboard.""
The first diagram shows how this may be accomplished in situations in which the house is located between a stopbank -that is, a barrier separating the river or drain from the area in which the house is located- and a hill or otherwise elevated area from which rainwater may run downhill (a phenomenon known as ""internal runoff""), potentially creating a pond in the area in which the house stands. In such a situation, the diagram shows that the stopbank should be higher than the 100-year flood level, although it does not show the minimum clearance required. At the same time, the house should be high enough that its floor is at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year ponding level.
The second diagram shows the way in which the house should be protected from floods in situations where there is no stopbank. In such cases, the house should simply be raised to a height at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood level. The second diagram does not show the effects of any internal runoff.
Both diagrams provide for a common solution, which is to have a minimum freeboard of 300 millimeters between the bottom of the house and the highest probable water level, be it the 100-year flood level or the 100-year ponding level."
"Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.
I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.
In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.
Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.
What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned."
"The diagram illustrates the effect of a stopbank in frequently flooded areas.
Overall, a stopbank divides the land from the rive or the drain and contributes to the formation of an internal ponding system on land. Houses can be built lower in areas with a stopbank.
It is clearly shown in the diagram that house floor level in areas without a stopbank must be 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood or ponding level. However, house floor level in areas with a stopbank can be much lower, even under the 100-year flood level. This might result from the fact that the stopbank is high enough to stop water from flooding in.
At the same time, the floodgate and berm under the stopbank connect the internal pond with the river outside. When the internal runoff leads to too much water on land, People can open the floodgate and let the water out into the river or drain."
"Couples living together before their weddings was once deemed as a disgrace. However, as our society keeps developing, more and more people start to accept the idea of cohabitation and put it into action. Admittedly, cohabitation can be advantageous. However, I do believe that people need to exercise caution when making the decision of living together with a partner.
It is true that living together with one's partner is a great opportunity for couples to know their partners as well as life after marriage better. Lovers tend to love each other so much that they can easily miss some tiny but crucial details or habits of their significant other. Cohabitation makes these details and habits unavoidable since two people are basically seeing each other for hours on a daily basis. Cohabitation can also be a buffer to help young couples move into a new stage in their lives. However, despite the fact that people are expected to completely understand their husband or wife-to-be as well as marriage itself, it is not guaranteed that they will still make the decision to marry that person after cohabitation.
Some people find it difficult or even dangerous to put the idea of cohabitation into implementation. Lovers in a long-distance relationship, for example, usually reside in different cities and can only see each other once in a while. In such situations, cohabitation means that one person must give up his or her career. This seems to be unfair and may lead to unnecessary breakups. Another instance is that some people can use cohabitation to, financially or sexually, take advantage of other people.
All in all, many advantages can be attributed to cohabitation, but I still think that people need to be cautious before moving in with a partner."
"The diagrams show the plan of a ground level of a house at present and after a presented refurbishment.
The most noticeable changes between the two plans regards the living room, which, in the prospective plan, is widened by removing the internal wall which is placed on the eastern side of the plan, the hall is joined with the living room and the internal doors are displaced at south entrance’s left.
It can also be seen that in the proposed plan, the stairs structure is rearranged in a half circle shape and placed on the north side of the house, propped up onto the western internal wall, whereas in the current plan it stands in the centre hosting a storage underneath.
The kitchen in the projected plan is embellished with a forniture set which surrounds the left wing of the house, although this may cause a shrink in terms of space availability .
In conclusion, the building works of the proposed plan of the ground floor are aimed to change the spatial layout, turning the living room into a full-fledged open space, by relocating the stairs. Amendments are to be made regarding the kitchen furniture, making it more comfortable and enjoyable compared to that of the existing plan."
"Accurately assessing which is the best way of teaching children is not an easy task, but when it comes to comparing between taking lesson at home or at school the issue becomes even more complicated to figure it out. In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.
A sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.
However, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to children’s school marks, but for themselves.
Moreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.
To my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.
Consequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home."
"The two given diagrams show the houses's existing ground floor and the proposed plan for a construction.
To commence, both plans have two entrances and the same number of internal doors. The existing plan has a bigger kitchen and two internal doors that separates the kitchen from the living room, wich gives a hall in between. In contrast to the proposed change wich has one internal wall. In addition, the proposed changes plan has a kitchen furniture, wich the existing plan don't have. To compare the stairs in each plan, the first diagram shows a shorter stairs with a storage beneath, however, the second diagram has a wider and lengher stairs without the storage.
Overall, the first diagram has a smaller living room, a hall, and two internal door in front of each other, and a storage. The proposed changes requires a larger living room, no hall, and a longer stars and no under stairs storage, as well as, kitchen furniture, and two internal doors next to each others."
"Education is a major reason for commnities to develop, espicially focusing on childern in this prosses. For the reason that kids are the future. Some people prefer their kids to get home-educated, while others believe that it is important for them to go to school. I am a strong advocate that children must go to school for a variety of reasons, wich will be mentioned in this essay.
To commence with, eventhough it is important to get a proper education and this can be found in both schools and at home, however, going to school on a daily basis can garantee the kid to communicate with his/her peers. And this can be in a negative or positive way- nowadays, but no matter which way the kid experiences, it is still going to be an experience that the kid will develop and learn from after. And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...
Likewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.
Overall, I believe that it is a better option for them to go to school instead of getting home-schooled. As well as, communication and playing with other children which can be a proper way for them to get developed mentally and pysically."
"The given map depicts the existing and proposed layout of a house’s ground floor, and some changes in design took place. Overall, there were a number of proposed notable changes to this area.
On the whole, some new furniture was added, while some existing layouts were removed or renovated in the proposed floor plan.
The most prominent change is the new, bigger stairs in the north of the ground floor replacing the existing hall, smaller stairs and the storage under the stairs. In addition, new furniture was added, and the empty field on the west side of the floor and the kitchen was filled with kitchen furniture.
There were also some extensive renovations to the internal doors and walls. First, the existing internal doors placed face to face in the north of the ground floor are planned to be moved next to the entrance, replacing a part of the existing internal wall on the west side. Second, the eastern internal wall is proposed to be demolished, and there will be no longer a block between the new stairs and the living room."
"People have different views about whether children should be educated at home or at school. Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.
On the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of children’s study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.
On the other hand, it perhaps better for children’s development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their “green house” once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.
In conclusion, I can understand why people might want children to be taught at home, but I strongly hold the opinion that it’s better for children’s development to send them to school."
"There are several differences on two diagrams of existing floor plan and proposed changes of it. Meanwhile, evidently illustrated above, some rough main features of the house remain the same such as the kitchen, living room and overall shape of the entire house.
One of the most obvious changes is a shift of stairs' location and their form. In the existing floor plan, stairs are rather narrow and attached to the left side of the living room's internal room, whereas, in proposed changes, stairs occupy most of the hall space in a bigger form.
Both two internal doors, one to the kitchen and one to the living room, have moved next to the entrance to provide a route into the kitchen as the living room no longer has an internal wall.
Once entered the kitchen, a new kitchen furniture can be seen at the far end of the kitchen which ultimately reduces the area of the space itself."
"In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.
There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.
On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.
All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people."

"The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.
At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.
The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen."
"Many people claim that home based education is most appropriate for the childrens and their progress, while others believe that studying at school is more import. While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.
To conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens."
"The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.
Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.
To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.
Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.
To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture."
"Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.
To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.
Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.
To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in."
"These bar graph and pie chart illustrates the amounts of people in both genders extending the various classes of adult education in 2009. As the bar chart shows the differences of genders of male and female deligates. And the bar charts told the porpotion of each age group of people who joined the evening classes of this year.
Overview, there are almost a half of participants are over 50 years old, while the one fourth of it are milddle aged group. However, the less portion of the generation is under 20 years. as the bar graph give the number of women that were interested in language classes and men similarly attended painting as 25 % and sculture classes and Drama classes were attended by 10 % of men.
Form the pie chart, there are 43 % of 50 year old age group were able to join evening classes, oppositely , only 5 % of people who are under 20 decided to attend the night classes. 16 % of young adults attended the classes in 2019.
As the bar graph illustrates that the women attended the classs more than men. The similar number of both genders are painting , they kept in the similar level. While, the large differences can be found in language course. The most unpopular clasess in either men or women are in sculpture learning."
"At present, there are the call of action for our social movement, and one of them is related to sexual equity. Many countries in Europe or Asia supported the legal marriage in LGBTQs, howere in some religious culture, the topic are very sensitive to be discussion and in worsely the LGBTQs were banned.
Love and being in the relationships depend on people' s mutual feeling. There is no boundaries of love, even they have same gender or different races, or even speak the different languages. Therefore, if they decided to settle down and live the rest of their lives together, the social determinants will be no longer to influence the relationship.
It is acceptable for the caring and understanding to maintain their marriage lives. As long as they could stay together and share thick or thin time together. The couple could have the good qualities of lives, some developed countries supported and launched legal LGBTQs marriage.
In conclusion, I strongly agree with legal LQBTQs marriage, so far they could share the moment together , they could extend their life expectancy and they could build the everlasting love until the last days of their lives. To love is to cherish their moments together."
"The bar chart provides the information from an adult education centre for the number of two different sexes in four evening courses in 2009 which were drama, painting, sculpture and language . While the pie chart further illustrates the age group of theses course.
Language course was the most popular one among the four course. However, two third of students in the course were women. The second popular course was painting, despite the number of female was lesser than the language course, but male students were slightly higher. Total 55 students in the course. Women in the drama course were still more than male which was 20 and only half of men joined the course. Men was the only higher number in sculpture. However, overall participants of this course was the least popular among all evening course.
Nearly half of the participants were aged 50 or above and only 5% aged under 20. The age group 40-49 was the second large group joining these evening course. While 11% to 16 % were the group between aged 20 to aged 39.
In conclude, women and the age group over 50 were more willing to spend their evenig time in learning various courses. The younger group below aged 29 were less interested in joining such evening course."
"It is a critical topic whether the society should accept gay marriage and legalized this kind of marriage. This especially sensative to some people with religious background or society with strong religious background.
Some argue that if the society accepts gay marriage, the traditional value and concept of marriage would be affected. The influences are deep and negative. For example, gay marriage is contradict to the nature and could not has next generation, in the long term, leads the reduction of population and harms the growth of economic. In addition, the society has to consider about legal issue if gay marriage is accept . For example, if an legal gay family could adapt children? Who can prossess the asset and wealth from the gay couple?
However, the trend for supporting gay marriage has increased in recent decades, probably because of the equal-right campaign rapidly spreading in the world. Many people state that marriage is a matter of two adults, as long as these two adults make their decision, there is no any harm to other , and the society. Some even believe same-sex marriage is also a nautre development which is long appearing in human history. Moreover, there is no evidence showing gay marriage would harm the society , rather to promote a multi-cultural, a society should accept different races, nationalties and gay people.
In my opinion, we should open our mind to accept gay marriage but we should also respect some religious person' s willingness. Whether gay marriage should be legal is a technical subject that I am not the right person to comment. However, I strongly hope people could respect others with different sexual preference, communication and understanding people with different values are the key for a harmony society. We have to admit that people have their right to choose their marriage in various ""types"" ."

"The two images presented give information regarding the gender and age of attenders of some eductional courses in 2009.
Overall, with the exception of sculpture courses, female is the dominant gender among the people who attended these evening courses. Moreover, most individuals were senior people, meaning they are 50 years old or older.
Beginning with language courses, there were exactly 40 women in these courses, where there were only 20 men in the same. Sculpture courses, the least attended, has around 5 women and 10 men. Painting courses, however, were visited by 30 women and approximately 24 men. Lastly, 20 women and 10 men decided to be visitors of the drama evening courses.
In terms of age diversification, 42 percent of attenders were old people, and only 5 percent of them were young people. Furthermore, 11 percent ranged from 20 to 29 years old, and 42 percent of all attenders aged between 20 and 49."
"Homosexual marriage has always been a topic of a great contrast of opinions among people. Many people view it as a legal right for individulas to marry whatever person, regardless of gender, they consider as a suitable partner. Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.
Certainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.
People supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.
People opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease. Opposiers also ague that if gay marriage was a natural behavior, religion would have advised to do it rather than giving severe warning for people who practice such behavior.
In conclusion, while both sides have countless followers, many governments around the world are leaning towards being fine with homosexual marriage. Personally, I think that every individual has the right to do whatever he desires as long as he does not affact others in the process."
"These three pie charts illustrate how dangerous waste products are disposed of in three countries. Overall, two countries, the Republic of Korea, and Sweden dispose of dangerous waste in three types, while there are five types of disposition in the United Kingdom.
Firstly, the Republic of Korea and Sweden deal with dangerous waste in recycling, incineration, and underground. The Republic of Korea has 69 percent of recycling
them, while Sweden is 25 percent. The Republic of Korea is approximately three times higher than Sweden. In contrast, Sweden mainly relies on dealing with dangerous waste by burying them underground. It is more than half, which means that more than two times higher than Korea. It is 55 percent in Sweden, and 22 percent in Korea respectively.
Interestingly, there are five types of dealing with dangerous waste in the United Kingdom. Mainly the UK utilizes in incineration. The percentage is 82 percent. The way of disposing type is much higher than Republic of Korea and Sweden.
In addition, the UK utilizes in Chemical treatment, and dumping at sea. Each percentage is eight percent respectively."
"Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea.
Firstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.
On the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.
Finally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop."
"The 3 pie charts illustrate how wastes are handled in Sweden, Rebublic of Korea, and the United Kingdom.
Simimlar to the Republic of Korea, Sweden uses three methods to take care of wastes: recycling, incineration, and underground burrying. The United Kingdom however, relies on chemical treatment and dumping at sea instead of recycling, while also using underground dumping and incineration. Recycling was used to deal with 69% of the republic of north koreas wastes, and 25% of sweden's wastes. Moreover, underground dumping was used mostly in the United Kingdom which handles a considerable 82 percent of its trash, compared to the Republic of Korea and Sweden where it was utilized to get rid of only 22 percent and 55% percent respectively.
Chemical treatment and dumping at sea were used only in the United Kingdom to clear 8 percent of wastes each. Incineration was the least common method used among the three countries as it only dealt with 2% of the United kingdoms waste, 9% of the republic of north Korea's, and 20% of swedens."
"Some individuals say that children's obesity is the fault of the parents, while others argue that it is strictly the governments fault. While both have effects on the childs habits from an early age, i think that it is mostly the parents fault.
It is debated that childhood obesity is mainly the parents responsibility for various reasons. Many parents schedueles and lifestyles are not fit for having a child as their routines are not flexible enough to properly take care of him/her. For example, in most western houses, both the mother and the father have jobs to attend everyday, and dont return home to their children till the late afternoon. By that time, the parents will both be too exausted to properly look after their child, which will lead to him/her eating any food no matter its quality and source such as fast foods and sweets, which are calorie dense and low volume. Furthermore, studies have shown that around 42 percent of parents in the United States did not care what their child consumed given it was cheap and does not require preparation. As far as i am concerned, this is enough evidence to justify it being mostly the parents fault.
On the other hand, others argue that it is primarely the governments fault. Governments have complete control over what advertisements can or cannot be portrayed to the public. Knowing that most advertisements we see are related to fast food chains and chocolate bars, we can deduce that it undoubtebly has a major effect on children which will beg their parents. to try some of this food. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that fast foods contain substances which encourage addiction. So when fast foods are easily accesible no matter which city you are in, parents will have a hard time controlling which foods their children eat. I agree that the government has a major influence on children, but their parents have greater controll over them.
In conclusion, while the government is undoubtebly the root of obesity amongst children, it is completely up to the parents to either develop this problem or put limitations to it."
"The pie graph shows how dangerous waste products are treated in three different countries.
First of all, the most striking information is that the vast majority of the products in the United Kingdom are burned, which is clearly not the case in Republic of Korea as well as in Sweden, who tend to use more ecological processes.
To begin, the United Kingdom use incineration for their waste products in 82% of the cases. It's quite the contrary in the other countries, because Sweden uses this technique only for a fifth of their products. It's even less the case in the Republic of Korea, which is slightly under 10%.
Secondly, recycling is a big part of how products are processed in Korea as it represents almost two third of the techniques that they use. In Sweden a quarter of the waste products are recycled, which represents only 2% in the UK.
Finally, the UK gets rid of 16% of their products by dumping them at sea or by chemical treatment which are techniques that do not exist in the other countries. In fact, in Korea, roughly a fifth of the products are buried undergound, while more than the half are treated as the same way in Sweden.
To conclude, the UK do not use recycling and burying techniques as treatment for waste products. They would rather burn them or dumping at sea as well as using chemical treatment. In Sweden and Korea, the treatments are more oriented towards recycling and burrying."
"Nowadays, obesity is increasingly affecting children. As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.
On the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.
However, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.
On the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.
Nevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.
To conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people."
"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.
According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).
The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively."
"A tremendous number of people believe that country's authorities are responsible for the rise in obesity in kids. However, there are both truth and falsehoods in this controversial statement, which will be discussed in this essay.
A lot of people may agree with this because they think that the government does not take measures to stop selling high sugar products, which may cause obesity, in schools. Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet. For instance, if children see a french fries and hamburgers advertisement in cartoons they are watching, they may want to eat fast food every day to be like their favourite cartoon character who enjoys the same meal.
On the other hand, some people are convinced that only parents are responsible for their own kids. They understand that children's food and sports habits are similar to those which their parents have. For example, if human beings explain to their kids how food influences physical and mental health and cook fresh, healthy dishes for the whole family every day, no one will want to buy fast food or even overeat.
In conclusion, the government is responsible the same as parents are. From my point of view, children's obesity is a huge problem that is difficult to solve in the modern world because of a lot of different factors. Nevertheless, if the government allows selling only healthy food in schools, and parents teach kids to do physical exercises and eat junk food only on holidays, obesity in children may have a chance to decrease with time."

"The charts show the information about population in France and India. Obviously, there are some differences, like the lifetime, sex retio, newborns. Next, we'll analysize and make comparisions.
First, let's look at the whole data and the feature of the chart. Blue stands for males and red stands for females. That is to say, in France the population is much smaller than that in India. India has a very large population. Secondly, people's lifetime is longer in France. And most of the females can live a longer life than males. And there are many more women than men who can live to the age of eighty-five. However, Generally speaking , In India, people can live to over 70 years old. So in a whold, Indian people live shorter than Frenchmen. At last, let's see the newborns. In France the number of babies are smaller, but the number of people aging 50 years old is larger, which shows that France is now facing the ageing
problems. More old people need so much care and attention.
In a word, the charts show that the two countries have their own features of population and it shows their different developments of societies."
"With the development of society, people have been paying more attention to children's education. Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile thing to do, but children shouldn't be given too much pressure.
Students in school usually have 5-6 classes, and after school they need develop their hobbies and have more time to do outdoor activities with their friends or classmates. In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.
My son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes. Kids need improve and learn new skills so as to have a better and brighter future, extra classes are needed ,but not too many or not too heavy. Be a whole person and be themselves is more important."
"The charts demonstrate the sex distribution in a various of age groups between France and India in 1984.
By and large, the males and females in the population of France almost balanced each other particularly in the age groups of 0-65 years old in 1984 with a symmetric sex composition. The age group 30-35 was revealed to be the highest percentages of population in France whereas the largest proportion of Indian population was in the age group 0-5 with a skewed sex ratio.
Going into more details, in regard to age structure of population, India had a vast majority of population in younger groups, constituting for 49% of population in the age groups of 0-20 years old. In particular, the highest percentages of Indian population presented in the age group 0-5 with the males to felamles ratio around 7% to 6.5%. Indian aged 70 years old or more was shown a steep decline, reaching less than 2% of population with balanced sex distribution.
In contrast, French people aged 10 - 40 years old made up the largest section in demographic structure, accounting for approximately 45% of population. The age group 30-35 reported as the highest proportion of population in France with around 4% of population in each gender. The males to females ratio in the age group 85 years old or more was represented to be the smallest of population in France, by 0.2% males to 1% females of population."
"Nowadays, trading businesses are made throughout the world resulting from the increased globalization. Consequently, employees are requested to have a variety of knowledge in their jobs due to remain a highly competitive capabilities in labour markets over the world. Parents have much struggles on the arrangement regarding additional classes out of school to their children in order to gain the competitive advantages in their future career. This eassy attempts to find out the main considerations on this.
There is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related.
On the other hand, it is not difficult to notice a lot of parents forcing their children into learning something that does not interest them. Sometimes, the intensive courses are arranged by parents to their children study at the weekends. As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes.
My take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only. This not only ruins the parent-child relationship but also may results in children's resistance to learning."
"These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.
Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.
Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.
Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%."
"Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.
To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.
On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.
To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying."

"The diagram depicts how to make a dough for a standard Italian pizza, by using just a few ingredients as wel as some utensils. The whole process takes a few minutes of active time to produce and some passive time to let the dough rest.
The ingredients required are as follows: four cups of 2000 grams of type '00' flour, one and a half cups or 325 grams of water, 2 teaspoons of salt and half a teaspoon of dry active yeast. They are first put into a stand mixer, mixed on slow speed for two minutes, then again on moderate speed for five minutes. For the last two minutes, the dough is mixed on slow speed.
After the mixing procedure, the dough is left to rise for at least two hours, until it is doubled in size. This is occurring as the yeast in it absorbs all the sugar and converts into carbon dioxide, which is a gas trapped in the dough. Afterwards, we deflate it in order to get rid of all the air inside. Finally, the dough is cut into three equal pieces and they are ready to be made into delicious pizza."
"With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.
When it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.
Although playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.
Having discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person."
"In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.
In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.
After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.
Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.
Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams."
"Doing sports has become part and parcel of our daily routine , and its beneficial effects are beyond dispute. However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.
To start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.
Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
Nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.
In contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of “ may the best man win”.
However, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.
Although the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.
According to my experience, I would not have become companionable and self-reliant if I had not joined the basketball team when I was 9 years old. Moreover, playing with others, has helped me to pushing my limits further ahead without breaching those of my teammate, being a sort of example to follow and a beacon to turn to, in case of needs."
"In this graph, the process of how to prepare a pizza-dough is presented with pitcures and numbers.
Base on the instruction, one can divide the whole process into two section. The first section is to show the ingredients are prepared in step 1 to 5. The second section only consists of step 6 and 7, which are the last two steps, is used to present how to work and cut the dough by hand.
To start, one need to prepare 500g of 00 flour and 325g of water, in the form of 4 and 2 cups, and mix them with 2 teaspoons of salt plus 1.5 teaspoons of dry active yeast. Once all these materials are placed into a stand mixer, it must be mixed for approximately 9 minutes. The stirring process is done by machine and can be divided into three distinctive stages: slow mixing for 2 minutes, medium mixing for 5 minutes and slow mixing again for at least 2 minutes. Once done, the mixture should be waited for no less than 2 hours and let it rise to double its size.
Afterward, the dough can be worked by hand, so all the air bubbles in the dough are removed. It is then cut into three equal sections. If one wish to be precise, the dough could also be cut into 3 parts of 275g each."
"While many regard team sports such as football and basketball are the better choices for sport, there are still some stick on to the individual sports. To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.
Firstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.
On the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).
In conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views."
"Making dough for a pizza needs seven steps. Before getting start, few ingredients need to be prepared which include 4 cups(500 grams) of 00 flour, 1 and half cups (325 grams）of water, also 2 tea spoon of salt, 1 and half tea spoon of dry active yeast.
First step, put all four ingredients which mentioned above into a stand mixer. Second step, in order to have a nice dough, patience is necessray, mixing all ingredients for 2 minutes on slow mode. Third step, increase the mixing speed to medium for another 5 minutes. Fourth step, turn down the speed back to slow mode for the last 2 minutes. Fifth step, let dough rest for minimum of 2 hours, this is a very important step for making of dough which can not be cut off, the dough size should double in size after this step. Sixth step, in order to work the dough to remove all air bubbles we need to roll the dough back and forward over and over again. Seventh step which is final step, cut the dough into 3 equal pieces which weigh in 275 grams each."
"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.
Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.
Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.
Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.
In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well."

"The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.
In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.
Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other."
"The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.
Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.
On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.
At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles."
"The line graph illustrates the trend of global food price index and average oil price from 2000 to 2011.
Overall, it can be seen that the food and oil price continuously rose with fluctuations over the period despite the fact that there was a sharp decrease between the year 2008 and 2009.
Looking at the detail, at the beginning the food price index and the oil price started at about 90 points and a little less than $30 per barrel respectively. These figures then gradually increased until during 2007 to the middle of 2008 the record jumped from around 140 points to above 220 points for the food index and soared approximately three times for the oil price.
For the rest of the year 2008, the level of the food index and oil price substantially dropped to 140 points and about $40 per barrel respectively. Since 2009, the value of the food index was always more than that of the oil price. However, the tendency of both indicators significantly grew with a noticeable dip in 2010, and eventually reached at 240 points for the food index and almost $100 per barrel for the oil price."
"Many teachers believe that an international exchange program would benefit all adolescent students. While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This is because children are likely to gain valuable experience which they can only have when studying aboard."
"The provided illustration depicts a map of a proposed town.
To summarize, the neighbourhood will consist of eleven blocks with most of them having two housings. The town shown in the map can be divided by the ring roads into two parts, which are inner and outer areas.
Putting into details, the outer part of the proposed town will include seven roads connecting to the ring roads and four of them will lead into the city center. There will be two industrial areas, one on the top left of the map and another at the bottom right. The other five blocks will be all containing two housings. Among all of them, only two blocks will be differed, while the first one which is at the bottom left will include an additional recreational area, the other one at the middle right part of the map will double the size of other blocks.
Moving on to the inner part, a square shaped city center will be constructed in the middle of the town, with two parking areas and two bus stands at the corners. There will be two recreational locations, one at the bottom left block with three sites and another one site at the top right block."
"International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.
To begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.
With the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.
To conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in."
"The diagram describes the map of a proposed village, although its name remains unknown. Overall, it is evident that the town will be configured around a central square, which will be mostly used as a parking lot.
Most buildings of the future town will be used as dwellings. Currently, there are 16 housing units that will be constructed both inside and outside the ring roads. Additionally, there are plans to build at least 5 recreational areas, so children and their families could spend time together while relaxing and playing. This will improve the citizens' quality of life.
Not all the areas of the proposed village, however, will be residential buildings and parks. At least 2 entire blocks will be used as industry areas. These blocks will be allocated at the town's periphery, which will hopefully reduce the amount of noise that the future inhabitants will be exposed to. On the other hand, at least 2 parking lots and 2 bus stands will be built at the central square. All the roads will be directed towards the central square, which will facilitate car circulation and mobilization. Finally, a few ring roads will be constructed to facilitate the inhabitants' access to their homes."
"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development."
"The map shown provides a rough overview of a proposed town structure. There is a clear distinction between residential areas, industries, roads, parking spaces, transport facilities such as buses, and recreational areas.
The diagram is structured in a circular manner, with divisions being made radially. The proposal suggests that the town be arbitrarily divided into an inner and outer ring by a Ring road. Originating from this, are multiple paths in a spoke-like manner. The internal circle has been divided into four regions, not including the central square and the external ring has seven similar parts.
The internal ring consists of two bus stands and parking areas in the middle of the town. Surrounding these lie homes and a few recreational areas interconnected by straight roads.
The outermost part of the map contains the industries, and housing facilities, separated by more lanes. There are two industries, one each on the left upper and right lower corner of the map. These have been provided their own sections distinct from homes, which occupy the other five subdivisions."
"The economic value added to a country hosting an international sports event has been said to benefit the community as a whole. However, many would argue that such events are a waste of useful resources, which could otherwise be streamlined to more needed areas. Although I am of the opinion that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, in this essay I will discuss both viewpoints with the help of relevant examples.
To support my view, I would like to bring to attention the 2009 Olympics held in China, which brought individuals from all over the world. The funds collected from the event provided a massive boost to the economy of the country, a significant portion of which was utilised for the welfare of underprivileged children in the nation.
On the other hand, it is imperative to note that a majority of profits gained from these shows go to the upper classes. For example, the IPL tournaments held in India have seemingly benefitted the uber rich participating in the auctions, while simultaneously draining tax-payers of their money.
However, coming from a community where sports serves as a bonding activity, I would also like to elaborate on the non-economic benefits of these games. The Olympic Games, for instance, garner a mass crowd from various nations bringing a variety of individuals together. They act as a nidus for soothing political tensions and improve diplomatic relations in times of unrest.
While many may object to the violent nature of some sports such as boxing, and the impact they have on young minds, these activities also serve as a conversation starter and are likely to ignite a spark of interest for sports in many.
In conclusion to the aforementioned points, I would like to state that while certain aspects of international sporting events must be checked upon, the pros are worth the effort of organising them."

"According to the diagram, the town includes two main sections: urban and suburban, which divides by a Ring Road.
A centre square accurately locates in the middle of the town, and a main road crosses the square then extends the length to two opposite directions. Two parkings and bus stands set up at the square. Moreover, all beginnings of road originate from this square. In the urban area, six blocks of housing surround the square and four recreational facilities locate among in the housings. Out of the Ring road is the suburban area, which is greater area than urban. Two industrial blocks separately locate the opposite corner of the town. In addition, ten blocks of housing dominantly occupy the most areas of the area. But just one recreational facility in the suburban area."
"The topic indicates the international sports events could bring beneficial for a country. There are several aspects to approve as below:
Firstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.
Secondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities. For example, in order to hold the 2008 BeiJing Olympic Game China built the nation stadium , nation swimming center and Olympic community so on. Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China. Thirdly, an international sports event will efficiently encourage the citizens devoted more passions and enthusiasms to participate in it. For example, Bei Jing is the host city to held the 2022 Winter Olympic Game, which encourage a lot of Chinese to learn and participate these winter sports, like snowboard, skating. Fourth, there is an opportunity to perform various cultures and histories of country to all visitors. Meanwhile, international sports events successfully held in a country that will enhance its international influence and the reputation in international stage.
Generally speaking, international sports events could bring various beneficial development, not only for country but also for individuals."
"The picture below demonstrates the evolution of cutting tools A and B ,over 0.6 million years in the Stone Age. It is compared with regards to its shape in different views ( front , side and back view) with its size being common (5 cm).
In overview , from 0.8 million years to 1.4 million years the tool making has become more sophisticated in size and shape .
The tool A front view is of a triangular shape and is strikingly similar to modern day spear heads, giving it a cutting edge over tool B whose body is more of oval and has less ability to pass through the enemy or animal.The side view of tool A shows the mastery that people have gained in making tools . The sharp edge with a large base provides a technological upper hand than that of tool B.
However , the back view of tool A and tool B has not much differences to its front view respectively."
"It is considered by many nowadays that sports has become a lucrative industry for the sports personals and companies bidding on teams and sports people . Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion .
Firstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors .
The business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent .
On the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector . The example of DLF IPL scam by Lalit Modi supports the argument of such people , commonwealth scam is also one such. The people in betting are luring players with money and fixing matches for their monetary gains which is killing the spirit of the game.
In conclusion, I support that high earnings in sports industry has had a positive impact on the quality of sports played and also being delivered on televisions with such quality."
"The illustration shows the different features from three different angles between two cutting tools in two particular age: 1.4million years ago and 0.8milllion year ago.
Both cutting tools height 5cm. The tool A was made in 1.4million years ago, much earlier age than the tool B. Thus its feature looks rawer than the tool B, and the tool A with raw edge apparent vision from front and back view. Moreover, the tool A is wider than the tool B due to lack polishing. Along with the development of cutting tools, the tool B looks smoother compare with the tool A. Furthermore, the feature of the tool B became thinner from side view. These changes of the tool B which could effectively reduce the frictions when it used."
"With the rapid development of economy and the increasing people’s enthusiasms, sports industry have been gaining the immense profits. It presents not only the professional players and companies with high earnings, also gain reputations in their fields. From personal view, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. But, from professional players and companies, I think the phenomenon is a positive development.
At first, as an audience, a fan or a consumption, I have to pay more costs for watching sports events or purchasing sport commodities than before. For example, the sport shoes from Nike and Adidas have risen in their prices up year by year. Thus, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. Secondly, on the contract, as professional players, particularly some very famous athletes who have a lot of proponents and gain high reputations all over the world. They have the abilities to create wealth. Besides, they have profound influences and authorities which inspire more people to engage in the sport. For example, Lional Messi, a world-famous soccer player, and Roger Federe, an iconic tennis player. Both they have a lot of followers, some of them are willing to contribute their money and passions to these sports. Furthermore, as a sport company, which would like to invest more capital to research and develop the higher quality of productions. Like high-tech swimming suit , high-tech shoes and high-tech equipment, which not only help the players to create their better scores but also widely attract a lot of people since they are issued . General speaking, sport companies are the dominant sponsors in various sports events. For example, Nike and Adidas company who have strongly supporting many sports events to held annually. Those sports events attract immense audiences simultaneously offer more opportunities to sport players.
On a conclusion, even if the sports industry is gaining high earnings, whereas which stimulate the development of sport economy and inspire many people to focus on sports activities."
"The given map illustrates the changes of the village Chorleywood, located near London, whose population has grown since 1850.
Overall, the structure of the village changed significantly from 1868 to 1994. It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.
The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.
Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course."
"It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.
Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.
Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.
In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government."
"Information is presented by two pie charts which compare the average household expenses, classified by 6 categories, in a particular country between 1950 and 2010. Overall, it can be clearly seen that housing was the major expenditure in 1950 while in 2010 food became the most popular expense.
Turning to the first main feature, in 1950 72.1% of households spent on housing which was the highest ratio whereas there was an exact 22.0% of households in 2010. Additionally, the second largest proportion of expenditures in 1950 was food, amounting to 11.2%. The figure for food then increased to a precise 34.0% in 2010 which was the largest percentage. With respect to other expenses, this category accounted for only 4.4% in 1950 before rising to an exact 19.2% in 2010.
Turning to another main feature, there was an increase in the transportation expense from a mere 3.3% in 1950 to a modest 14.0% in 2010. In terms of health care, households spent on this category the least in both years, contributing to 2.4% and 4.5% in 1950 and 2010 respectively. The last key point to note is education expenditure which decreased slightly from 6.6% in 1950 to 6.3% in 2010."
"Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for people’s life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of people’s competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.
It is true that group activities potentially strengthen people’s social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster people’s communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.
In spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other people’s progress.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life."
"Those pie charts give information about average house expenditures during two different periods of time, 1950 and 2010. Below I will describe both ones in details about what it was like during those two different periods of time.
First of all, we can see that during the year 1950, people used to spend 72.1% from their income to pay for rent and 22.0% in 2010, that means, we have seen a great decline comparing those two years together. The percentage for food which is 11.2% in 1950 and 34.0% in 2010 mark in a great increase in the recent times.
The percentage for healthcare during 1950 and 2010 are 2.4% and 4.5% respectively marks in increase giving an idea that people are paying more from their income for healthcare. We have seen a huge increase for those two period of times for transportation which is 3.3 and 14.0 for transportation.
In terms of education for those two years, the percentage almost stays the same 6.3 and 6.6 respectively with a little difference between both of them. For the last point which is for other things not mentioned here, maybe for unexpeted items and other stuff that they might not been buying on a monthly basis, we can see the percentage increasing. Maybe household members spend more on items that can't be counted in a monthly budget."
"Group or team activities are great ways of teaching more important life skills, however, there are activities which can be done alone that will also teach some important skills. Both ones are important in teaching life skills. Below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.
First of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.
In fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.
In conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider. However, in my opinion, doing activities in group or as a team can teach more important life skills than those activities which are done alone because group activities let us explore the world around us which will later teach us important skills which are necessary for our survival."
"The pie charts illustrates how the movement of household has been expanding in a country in the period 1950 and 2010.
According to the pie chart in 1950 the housing works has taken the largest percentage among the other services. This is apparently refer to the need a lot of spending because the families were bigger than today. While the transportation and the others' cash is considered much the least between the whole needs.
In 2010, there is a big change in the whole life style which truly impact on families and their ways of spending money. First of all, buying food is quite important as original source for people energy, it has taken the largest amount in exactly 34%.And because many wives become worker, the need to buy ready meals become more necessary than before. Also, it is clear that transportation is almost nearly equal.
As to what has shown there is rapidly decreasing in housing's spending in 2010,and this is justified by the completely change of life in using less and simple thing instead of using expensive and too much staff, and also select smaller house rather than bigger ones. Moreover most families prefer to spend money on their pleasure and joyful life. It is noticed that other spending has jumped sharply from 4% to 19.2% which means people are turning to be consumers. Finally there is no doubt that education has less priority in both dates.
To sum up, we could say that the amount of expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010 has differed according to the lifestyle of each family."
"There is no doubt that activities whether in group or individual considered as an important source for learning skills.These people claim that life skills can be developing and growing increasingly through team activities more than those which are done alone. This essay will argue why collaborating works against isolating ones are entirely necessary in gaining life abilities and competencies.
It is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.
Although some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.
This essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone. In my opinion, it is quite important and interesting way to let people contacting and teaching each other a plenty of skills in the same time. However, it is long way to guide some people teaching themselves what they need throughout the life.

"The pi charts illustrate the comparisons the average of household expenditures in 1950 and 2010 in a country. Overall, a considerable reduction in housing can be seen, while the expenditures in food remarkably soared in 2010.
Housing expenditures occupied nearly three-fourth, in 1950. In contrast, the expenditures plummeted to 22 percent in 2010. Alternatively, the expenditures for food tripled, compared with 1950 and 2010. Specifically, the percentage of food used to be 11.2 percent and drastically rose up to 34 percent.
In addition, there are some expenditures increased. For example, transport, and other. These percentages were 3.3 percent in transport, and 4.4 percent in other in 1950. But both percentages grow up to 14 percent and 19.2 percent in 2050 respectively. Interestingly, when it comes to expenditure in education, there is not a significant change. It was 6.6 percent in 1950 and it is 6.3 percent in 2010. Health care also slightly changed, the percentage of expenditure was 2.4 in 1950 and increased to 4.5 percent in 2010.

"The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,
and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.
Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people are
the most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.
Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.
Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive."
"The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.
Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.

"Double or Nothing: Multiplicative Incentive Mechanisms for Crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing has gained immense popularity in machine learning applications for obtaining large amounts of labeled data. Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural no-free-lunch requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible  mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers.  Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a multiplicative form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit.  In preliminary experiments involving over several hundred workers, we observe a significant reduction in the error rates under our unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure."
"Learning with Symmetric Label Noise: The Importance of Being Unhinged. Convex potential minimisation is the de facto approach to binary classification. However, Long and Servedio [2008] proved that under symmetric label noise (SLN), minimisation of any convex potential over a linear function class can result in classification performance equivalent to random guessing. This ostensibly shows that convex losses are not SLN-robust. In this paper, we propose a convex, classification-calibrated loss and prove that it is SLN-robust. The loss avoids the Long and Servedio [2008] result by virtue of being negatively unbounded. The loss is a modification of the hinge loss, where one does not clamp at zero; hence, we call it the unhinged loss. We show that the optimal unhinged solution is equivalent to that of a strongly regularised SVM, and is the limiting solution for any convex potential; this implies that strong l2 regularisation makes most standard learners SLN-robust. Experiments confirm the unhinged loss’ SLN-robustness."
"Algorithmic Stability and Uniform Generalization. One of the central questions in statistical learning theory is to determine the conditions under which agents can learn from experience. This includes the necessary and sufficient conditions for generalization from a given finite training set to new observations. In this paper, we prove that algorithmic stability in the inference process is equivalent to uniform generalization across all parametric loss functions. We provide various interpretations of this result.  For instance,  a relationship is proved between stability and data processing, which reveals that algorithmic stability can be improved by post-processing the inferred hypothesis or by augmenting training examples with artificial noise prior to learning. In addition, we establish a relationship between algorithmic stability and the size of the observation space, which provides a formal justification for dimensionality reduction methods. Finally, we connect algorithmic stability to the size of the hypothesis space, which recovers the classical PAC result that the size (complexity) of the hypothesis space should be controlled in order to improve algorithmic stability and improve generalization."
"Adaptive Low-Complexity Sequential Inference for Dirichlet Process Mixture Models. We develop a sequential low-complexity inference procedure for Dirichlet process mixtures of Gaussians for online clustering and parameter estimation when the number of clusters are unknown a-priori. We present an easily computable, closed form parametric expression for the conditional likelihood, in which hyperparameters are recursively updated as a function of the streaming data assuming conjugate priors. Motivated by large-sample asymptotics, we propose a noveladaptive low-complexity design for the Dirichlet process concentration parameter and show that the number of classes grow at most at a logarithmic rate. We further prove that in the large-sample limit, the conditional likelihood and datapredictive distribution become asymptotically Gaussian. We demonstrate through experiments on synthetic and real data sets that our approach is superior to otheronline state-of-the-art methods."
"Covariance-Controlled Adaptive Langevin Thermostat for Large-Scale Bayesian Sampling. Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian posterior inference is a common approach used in machine learning. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedures that are used are often discrete-time analogues of associated stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These SDEs are guaranteed to leave invariant the required posterior distribution. An area of current research addresses the computational benefits of stochastic gradient methods in this setting. Existing techniques rely on estimating the variance or covariance of the subsampling error, and typically assume constant variance. In this article, we propose a covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat that can effectively dissipate parameter-dependent noise while maintaining a desired target distribution. The proposed method achieves a substantial speedup over popular alternative schemes for large-scale machine learning applications."
"Robust Portfolio Optimization. We propose a robust portfolio optimization approach based on quantile statistics. The proposed method is robust to extreme events in asset returns, and accommodates large portfolios under limited historical data. Specifically, we show that the risk of the estimated portfolio converges to the oracle optimal risk with parametric rate under weakly dependent asset returns. The theory does not rely on higher order moment assumptions, thus allowing for heavy-tailed asset returns. Moreover, the rate of convergence quantifies that the size of the portfolio under management is allowed to scale exponentially with the sample size of the historical data. The empirical effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated under both synthetic and real stock data. Our work extends existing ones by achieving robustness in high dimensions, and by allowing serial dependence."
"Logarithmic Time Online Multiclass prediction. We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large number of classes (k), with the goal of obtaining train and test time complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree construction approaches for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the theoretical front, we formulate a new objective function, which is optimized at each node of the tree and creates dynamic partitions of the data which are both pure (in terms of class labels) and balanced. We demonstrate that under favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves with low label entropy. However, the objective function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that this online algorithm quickly achieves improvement in test error compared to more common logarithmic training time approaches, which makes it a plausible method in computationally constrained large-k applications."
Planar Ultrametrics for Image Segmentation. We study the problem of hierarchical clustering on planar graphs. We formulate this in terms of finding the closest ultrametric to a specified set of distances and solve it using an LP relaxation that leverages minimum cost perfect matching as a subroutine to efficiently explore the space of planar partitions. We apply our algorithm to the problem of hierarchical image segmentation.
"Expressing an Image Stream with a Sequence of Natural Sentences. We propose an approach for generating a sequence of natural sentences for an image stream. Since general users usually take a series of pictures on their special moments, much online visual information exists in the form of image streams, for which it would better take into consideration of the whole set to generate natural language descriptions. While almost all previous studies have dealt with the relation between a single image and a single natural sentence, our work extends both input and output dimension to a sequence of images and a sequence of sentences. To this end, we design a novel architecture called coherent recurrent convolutional network (CRCN), which consists of convolutional networks, bidirectional recurrent networks, and entity-based local coherence model. Our approach directly learns from vast user-generated resource of blog posts as text-image parallel training data. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art candidate methods, using both quantitative measures (e.g. BLEU and top-K recall) and user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk."
"Parallel Correlation Clustering on Big Graphs. Given a similarity graph between items, correlation clustering (CC) groups similar items together and dissimilar ones apart. One of the most popular CC algorithms is KwikCluster:  an algorithm that serially clusters neighborhoods of vertices, and obtains a 3-approximation ratio. Unfortunately, in practice KwikCluster requires a large number of clustering rounds, a potential bottleneck for large graphs.We present C4 and ClusterWild!, two algorithms for parallel correlation clustering that run in a polylogarithmic number of rounds, and provably achieve nearly linear speedups. C4 uses concurrency control to enforce serializability of a parallel clustering process, and guarantees a 3-approximation ratio. ClusterWild! is a coordination free algorithm that abandons consistency for the benefit of better scaling; this leads to a provably small loss in the 3 approximation ratio.We provide extensive experimental results for both algorithms,  where we outperform the state of the art, both in terms of clustering accuracy and running time. We show that our algorithms can cluster billion-edge graphs in under 5 seconds on 32 cores, while achieving a 15x speedup."
"Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks. State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully-convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. RPNs are trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. With a simple alternating optimization, RPN and Fast R-CNN can be trained to share convolutional features. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 (73.2% mAP) and 2012 (70.4% mAP) using 300 proposals per image. Code is available at https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn."
Space-Time Local Embeddings. Space-time is a profound concept in physics. This concept was shown to be useful for dimensionality reduction. We present basic definitions with interesting counter-intuitions. We give theoretical propositions to show that space-time is a more powerful representation than Euclidean space. We apply this concept to manifold learning for preserving local information. Empirical results on non-metric datasets show that more information can be preserved in space-time.
"A Convergent Gradient Descent Algorithm for Rank Minimization and Semidefinite Programming from Random Linear Measurements. We propose a simple, scalable, and fast gradient descent algorithm to optimize a nonconvex objective for the rank minimization problem and a closely related family of semidefinite programs.  With $O(r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ random measurements of a positive semidefinite $n\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ and condition number $\kappa$, our method is guaranteed to converge linearly to the global optimum."
"Smooth Interactive Submodular Set Cover. Interactive submodular set cover is an interactive variant of submodular set cover over a hypothesis class of submodular functions, where the goal is to satisfy all sufficiently plausible submodular functions to a target threshold using as few (cost-weighted) actions as possible. It models settings where there is uncertainty regarding which submodular function to optimize. In this paper, we propose a new extension, which we call smooth interactive submodular set cover, that allows the target threshold to vary depending on the plausibility of each hypothesis. We present the first algorithm for this more general setting with theoretical guarantees on optimality. We further show how to extend our approach to deal with real-valued functions, which yields new theoretical results for real-valued submodular set cover for both the interactive and non-interactive settings."
"Galileo: Perceiving Physical Object Properties by Integrating a Physics Engine with Deep Learning. Humans demonstrate remarkable abilities to predict physical events in dynamic scenes, and to infer the physical properties of objects from static images. We propose a generative model for solving these problems of physical scene understanding from real-world videos and images. At the core of our generative model is a 3D physics engine, operating on an object-based representation of physical properties, including mass, position, 3D shape, and friction. We can infer these latent properties using relatively brief runs of MCMC, which drive simulations in the physics engine to fit key features of visual observations. We further explore directly mapping visual inputs to physical properties, inverting a part of the generative process using deep learning. We name our model Galileo, and evaluate it on a video dataset with simple yet physically rich scenarios. Results show that Galileo is able to infer the physical properties of objects and predict the outcome of a variety of physical events, with an accuracy comparable to human subjects. Our study points towards an account of human vision with generative physical knowledge at its core, and various recognition models as helpers leading to efficient inference."
"On the Pseudo-Dimension of Nearly Optimal Auctions. This paper develops a general approach, rooted in statistical learning theory, to learning an approximately revenue-maximizing auction from data. We introduce t-level auctions to interpolate between simple auctions, such as welfare maximization with reserve prices, and optimal auctions, thereby balancing the competing demands of expressivity and simplicity. We prove that such auctions have small representation error, in the sense that for every product distribution F over bidders’ valuations, there exists a t-level auction with small t and expected revenue close to optimal. We show that the set of t-level auctions has modest pseudo-dimension (for polynomial t) and therefore leads to small learning error. One consequence of our results is that, in arbitrary single-parameter settings, one can learn a mechanism with expected revenue arbitrarily close to optimal from a polynomial number of samples."
"Unlocking neural population non-stationarities using hierarchical dynamics models. Neural population activity often exhibits rich variability. This variability is thought to arise from single-neuron stochasticity, neural dynamics on short time-scales, as well as  from modulations of neural firing properties on long time-scales, often referred to as non-stationarity. To better understand the nature of co-variability in neural circuits and their impact on cortical information processing, we introduce a  hierarchical dynamics model that is able to capture inter-trial modulations in firing rates, as well as neural population dynamics. We derive an algorithm for Bayesian Laplace propagation for fast posterior inference, and demonstrate that our model provides a better account of the structure of neural firing than existing stationary dynamics models, when applied to neural population recordings from primary visual cortex."
"Bayesian Manifold Learning: The Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM). We introduce the Locally Linear Latent Variable Model (LL-LVM), a probabilistic model for non-linear manifold discovery that describes a joint distribution over observations, their manifold coordinates and locally linear maps conditioned on a set of neighbourhood relationships. The model allows straightforward variational optimisation of the posterior distribution on coordinates and locally linear maps from the latent space to the observation space given the data. Thus, the LL-LVM encapsulates the local-geometry preserving intuitions that underlie non-probabilistic methods such as locally linear embedding (LLE). Its probabilistic semantics make it easy to evaluate the quality of hypothesised neighbourhood relationships, select the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold, construct out-of-sample extensions and to combine the manifold model with additional probabilistic models that capture the structure of coordinates within the manifold."
"Color Constancy by Learning to Predict Chromaticity from Luminance. Color constancy is the recovery of true surface color from observed color, and requires estimating the chromaticity of scene illumination to correct for the bias it induces. In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics of natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves be a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant estimation method that is built around a classifier for identifying the true chromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color channels). During inference, each pixel's observed color restricts its true chromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of illuminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a distribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the scene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these distributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over discretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural images. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth reflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite its simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn the luminance-to-chromaticity classifier end-to-end. Using stochastic gradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors in the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to further improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error distribution."
"Fast and Accurate Inference of Plackett–Luce Models. We show that the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of models derived from Luce's choice axiom (e.g., the Plackett-Luce model) can be expressed as the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. This conveys insight into several recently proposed spectral inference algorithms. We take advantage of this perspective and formulate a new spectral algorithm that is significantly more accurate than previous ones for the Plackett--Luce model. With a simple adaptation, this algorithm can be used iteratively, producing a sequence of estimates that converges to the ML estimate. The ML version runs faster than competing approaches on a benchmark of five datasets. Our algorithms are easy to implement, making them relevant for practitioners at large."
"Probabilistic Line Searches for Stochastic Optimization. In deterministic optimization, line searches are a standard tool ensuring stability and efficiency. Where only stochastic gradients are available, no direct equivalent has so far been formulated, because uncertain gradients do not allow for a strict sequence of decisions collapsing the search space. We construct a probabilistic line search by combining the structure of existing deterministic methods with notions from Bayesian optimization. Our method retains a Gaussian process surrogate of the univariate optimization objective, and uses a probabilistic belief over the Wolfe conditions to monitor the descent. The algorithm has very low computational cost, and no user-controlled parameters. Experiments show that it effectively removes the need to define a learning rate for stochastic gradient descent."
"Inferring Algorithmic Patterns with Stack-Augmented Recurrent Nets. Despite the recent achievements in machine learning,  we are still very far from achieving real artificial intelligence. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of standard deep learning approaches and show that some of these limitations can be overcome by learning how to grow the complexity of a model in a structured way. Specifically,  we study the simplest sequence prediction problems that are beyond the scope of what is learnable with standard recurrent networks, algorithmically generated sequences  which can only be learned by models which have the capacity to count and to memorize  sequences. We show that some basic algorithms can be learned from sequential data using a recurrent network associated with a trainable memory."
"Where are they looking?. Humans have the remarkable ability to follow the gaze of other people to identify what they are looking at. Following eye gaze, or gaze-following, is an important ability that allows us to understand what other people are thinking, the actions they are performing, and even predict what they might do next. Despite the importance of this topic, this problem has only been studied in limited scenarios within the computer vision community.  In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based approach for gaze-following and a new benchmark dataset for thorough evaluation. Given an image and the location of a head, our approach follows the gaze of the person and identifies the object being looked at. After training, the network is able to discover how to extract head pose and gaze orientation, and to select objects in the scene that are in the predicted line of sight and likely to be looked at (such as televisions, balls and food). The quantitative evaluation shows that our approach produces reliable results, even when viewing only the back of the head. While our method outperforms several baseline approaches, we are still far from reaching human performance at this task. Overall, we believe that this is a challenging and important task that deserves more attention from the community."
"The Pareto Regret Frontier for Bandits. Given a multi-armed bandit problem it may be desirable to achieve a smaller-than-usual worst-case regret for some special actions. I show that the price for such unbalanced worst-case regret guarantees is rather high. Specifically, if an algorithm enjoys a worst-case regret of B with respect to some action, then there must exist another action for which the worst-case regret is at least Ω(nK/B), where n is the horizon and K the number of actions. I also give upper bounds in both the stochastic and adversarial settings showing that this result cannot be improved. For the stochastic case the pareto regret frontier is characterised exactly up to constant factors."
"On the Limitation of Spectral Methods: From the Gaussian Hidden Clique Problem to Rank-One Perturbations of Gaussian Tensors. We consider the following detection problem: given a realization of asymmetric matrix $X$ of dimension $n$, distinguish between the hypothesisthat all upper triangular variables are i.i.d. Gaussians variableswith mean 0 and variance $1$ and the hypothesis that there is aplanted principal submatrix $B$ of dimension $L$ for which all upper triangularvariables are i.i.d. Gaussians with mean $1$ and variance $1$, whereasall other upper triangular elements of $X$ not in $B$ are i.i.d.Gaussians variables with mean 0 and variance $1$. We refer to this asthe `Gaussian hidden clique problem'. When $L=( 1 + \epsilon) \sqrt{n}$ ($\epsilon > 0$), it is possible to solve thisdetection problem with probability $1 - o_n(1)$ by computing thespectrum of $X$ and considering the largest eigenvalue of $X$.We prove that when$L < (1-\epsilon)\sqrt{n}$ no algorithm that examines only theeigenvalues of $X$can detect the existence of a hiddenGaussian clique, with error probability vanishing as $n \to \infty$.The result above is an immediate consequence of a more general result on rank-oneperturbations of $k$-dimensional Gaussian tensors.In this context we establish a lower bound on the criticalsignal-to-noise ratio below which a rank-one signal cannot be detected."
"Measuring Sample Quality with Stein's Method. To improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo estimation, practitioners are turning to biased Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures that trade off asymptotic exactness for computational speed.  The reasoning is sound: a reduction in variance due to more rapid sampling can outweigh the bias introduced.  However, the inexactness creates new challenges for sampler and parameter selection, since standard measures of sample quality like effective sample size do not account for asymptotic bias.  To address these challenges, we introduce a new computable quality measure based on Stein's method that bounds the discrepancy between sample and target expectations over a large class of test functions.  We use our tool to compare exact, biased, and deterministic sample sequences and illustrate applications to hyperparameter selection, convergence rate assessment, and quantifying bias-variance tradeoffs in posterior inference."
"Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution. Super resolving a low-resolution video is usually handled by either single-image super-resolution (SR) or multi-frame SR. Single-Image SR deals with each video frame independently, and ignores intrinsic temporal dependency of video frames which actually plays a very important role in video super-resolution. Multi-Frame SR generally extracts motion information, e.g. optical flow, to model the temporal dependency, which often shows high computational cost. Considering that recurrent neural network (RNN) can model long-term contextual information of temporal sequences well, we propose a bidirectional recurrent convolutional network for efficient multi-frame SR.Different from vanilla RNN, 1) the commonly-used recurrent full connections are replaced with weight-sharing convolutional connections and 2) conditional convolutional connections from previous input layers to current hidden layer are added for enhancing visual-temporal dependency modelling. With the powerful temporal dependency modelling, our model can super resolve videos with complex motions and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Due to the cheap convolution operations, our model has a low computational complexity and runs orders of magnitude faster than other multi-frame methods."
"Bounding errors of Expectation-Propagation. Expectation Propagation is a very popular algorithm for variational inference, but comes with few theoretical guarantees. In this article, we prove that the approximation errors made by EP can be bounded. Our bounds have an asymptotic interpretation in the number n of datapoints, which allows us to study EP's convergence with respect to the true posterior. In particular, we show that EP converges at a rate of $O(n^{-2})$ for the mean, up to an order of magnitude faster than the traditional Gaussian approximation at the mode. We also give similar asymptotic expansions for moments of order 2 to 4, as well as excess Kullback-Leibler cost (defined as the additional KL cost incurred by using EP rather than the ideal Gaussian approximation). All these expansions highlight the superior convergence properties of EP. Our approach for deriving those results is likely applicable to many similar approximate inference methods. In addition, we introduce bounds on the moments of log-concave distributions that may be of independent interest."
"A fast, universal algorithm to learn parametric nonlinear embeddings. Nonlinear embedding algorithms such as stochastic neighbor embedding do dimensionality reduction by optimizing an objective function involving similarities between pairs of input patterns. The result is a low-dimensional projection of each input pattern. A common way to define an out-of-sample mapping is to optimize the objective directly over a parametric mapping of the inputs, such as a neural net. This can be done using the chain rule and a nonlinear optimizer, but is very slow, because the objective involves a quadratic number of terms each dependent on the entire mapping's parameters. Using the method of auxiliary coordinates, we derive a training algorithm that works by alternating steps that train an auxiliary embedding with steps that train the mapping. This has two advantages: 1) The algorithm is universal in that a specific learning algorithm for any choice of embedding and mapping can be constructed by simply reusing existing algorithms for the embedding and for the mapping. A user can then try possible mappings and embeddings with less effort. 2) The algorithm is fast, and it can reuse N-body methods developed for nonlinear embeddings, yielding linear-time iterations."
"Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks. Here we introduce a new model of natural textures based on the feature spaces of convolutional neural networks optimised for object recognition. Samples from the model are of high perceptual quality demonstrating the generative power of neural networks trained in a purely discriminative fashion. Within the model, textures are represented by the correlations between feature maps in several layers of the network. We show that across layers the texture representations increasingly capture the statistical properties of natural images while making object information more and more explicit. The model provides a new tool to generate stimuli for neuroscience and might offer insights into the deep representations learned by convolutional neural networks."
"Extending Gossip Algorithms to Distributed Estimation of U-statistics. Efficient and robust algorithms for decentralized estimation in networks are essential to many distributed systems. Whereas distributed estimation of sample mean statistics has been the subject of a good deal of attention, computation of U-statistics, relying on more expensive averaging over pairs of observations, is a less investigated area. Yet, such data functionals are essential to describe global properties of a statistical population, with important examples including Area Under the Curve, empirical variance, Gini mean difference and within-cluster point scatter. This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the U-statistic of interest. We establish convergence rate bounds of O(1 / t) and O(log t / t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where t is the number of iterations, with explicit data and network dependent terms. Beyond favorable comparisons in terms of rate analysis, numerical experiments provide empirical evidence the proposed algorithms surpasses the previously introduced approach."
"Streaming, Distributed Variational Inference for Bayesian Nonparametrics. This paper presents a methodology for creating streaming, distributed inference algorithms for Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models. In the proposed framework, processing nodes receive a sequence of data minibatches, compute a variational posterior for each, and make asynchronous streaming updates to a central model. In contrast to previous algorithms, the proposed framework is truly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and truncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their components, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP posterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper develops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences, and provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an application of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental results demonstrating its practical scalability and performance."
"Learning visual biases from human imagination. Although the human visual system can recognize many concepts under challengingconditions, it still has some biases. In this paper, we investigate whether wecan extract these biases and transfer them into a machine recognition system.We introduce a novel method that, inspired by well-known tools in humanpsychophysics, estimates the biases that the human visual system might use forrecognition, but in computer vision feature spaces.   Our experiments aresurprising, and suggest that classifiers from the human visual system can betransferred into a machine with some success. Since these classifiers seem tocapture favorable biases in the human visual system, we further present an SVMformulation that constrains the orientation of the SVM hyperplane to agree withthe bias from human visual system. Our results suggest that transferring thishuman bias into machines may help object recognition systems generalize acrossdatasets and perform better when very little training data is available."
"Smooth and Strong: MAP Inference with Linear Convergence. Maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference is an important task for many applications. Although the standard formulation gives rise to a hard combinatorial optimization problem, several effective approximations have been proposed and studied in recent years. We focus on linear programming (LP) relaxations, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many applications. However, optimization of the resulting program is in general challenging due to non-smoothness and complex non-separable constraints.Therefore, in this work we study the benefits of augmenting the objective function of the relaxation with strong convexity. Specifically, we introduce strong convexity by adding a quadratic term to the LP relaxation objective. We provide theoretical guarantees for the resulting programs, bounding the difference between their optimal value and the original optimum. Further, we propose suitable optimization algorithms and analyze their convergence."
"Copeland Dueling Bandits. A version of the dueling bandit problem is addressed in which a Condorcet winner may not exist. Two algorithms are proposed that instead seek to minimize regret with respect to the Copeland winner, which, unlike the Condorcet winner, is guaranteed to exist. The first, Copeland Confidence Bound (CCB), is designed for small numbers of arms, while the second, Scalable Copeland Bandits (SCB), works better for large-scale problems. We provide theoretical results bounding the regret accumulated by CCB and SCB, both substantially improving existing results.  Such existing results either offer bounds of the form O(K log T) but require restrictive assumptions, or offer bounds of the form O(K^2 log T) without requiring such assumptions.  Our results offer the best of both worlds: O(K log T) bounds without restrictive assumptions."
"Optimal Ridge Detection using Coverage Risk. We introduce the concept of coverage risk as an error measure for density ridge estimation.The coverage risk generalizes the mean integrated square error to set estimation.We propose two risk estimators for the coverage risk and we show that we can select tuning parameters by minimizing the estimated risk.We study the rate of convergence for coverage risk and prove consistency of the risk estimators.We apply our method to three simulated datasets and to cosmology data.In all the examples, the proposed method successfully recover the underlying density structure."
"Top-k Multiclass SVM. Class ambiguity is typical in image classification problems with a large number of classes. When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss. We propose top-k multiclass SVM as a direct method to optimize for top-k performance. Our generalization of the well-known multiclass SVM is based on a tight convex upper bound of the top-k error. We propose a fast optimization scheme based on an efficient projection onto the top-k simplex, which is of its own interest. Experiments on five datasets show consistent improvements in top-k accuracy compared to various baselines."
"Policy Evaluation Using the Ω-Return. We propose the Ω-return as an alternative to the λ-return currently used by the TD(λ) family of algorithms. The benefit of the Ω-return is that it accounts for the correlation of different length returns. Because it is difficult to compute exactly, we suggest one way of approximating the Ω-return. We provide empirical studies that suggest that it is superior to the λ-return and γ-return for a variety of problems."
"Orthogonal NMF through Subspace Exploration. Orthogonal Nonnegative Matrix Factorization {(ONMF)} aims to approximate a nonnegative matrix as the product of two $k$-dimensional nonnegative factors, one of which has orthonormal columns. It yields potentially useful data representations as superposition of disjoint parts, while it has been shown to work well for clustering tasks where traditional methods underperform. Existing algorithms rely mostly on heuristics, which despite their good empirical performance, lack provable performance guarantees.We present a new ONMF algorithm with provable approximation guarantees.For any constant dimension~$k$, we obtain an additive EPTAS without any assumptions on the input. Our algorithm relies on a novel approximation to the related Nonnegative Principal Component Analysis (NNPCA) problem; given an arbitrary data matrix, NNPCA seeks $k$ nonnegative components that jointly capture most of the variance. Our NNPCA algorithm is of independent interest and generalizes previous work that could only obtain guarantees for a single component. We evaluate our algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets and show that their performance matches or outperforms the state of the art."
"Stochastic Online Greedy Learning with Semi-bandit Feedbacks. The greedy algorithm is extensively studied in the field of combinatorial optimization for decades. In this paper, we address the online learning problem when the input to the greedy algorithm is stochastic with unknown parameters that have to be learned over time. We first propose the greedy regret and $\epsilon$-quasi greedy regret as learning metrics comparing with the performance of offline greedy algorithm. We then propose two online greedy learning algorithms with semi-bandit feedbacks, which use multi-armed bandit and pure exploration bandit policies at each level of greedy learning, one for each of the regret metrics respectively. Both algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ problem-dependent regret bound ($T$ being the time horizon) for a general class of combinatorial structures and reward functions that allow greedy solutions. We further show that the bound is tight in $T$ and other problem instance parameters."
"Deeply Learning the Messages in Message Passing Inference. Deep structured output learning shows great promise in tasks like semantic image segmentation. We proffer a new, efficient deep structured model learning scheme, in which we show how deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used to directly estimate the messages in message passing inference for structured prediction with Conditional Random Fields CRFs). With such CNN message estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for message calculation. This confers significant efficiency for learning, since otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient iteration. The network output dimension of message estimators is the same as the number of classes, rather than exponentially growing in the order of the potentials. Hence it is more scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our method to semantic image segmentation and achieve impressive performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness and usefulness of our CNN message learning method."
Synaptic Sampling: A Bayesian Approach to Neural Network Plasticity and Rewiring. We reexamine in this article the conceptual and mathematical framework for understanding the organization of plasticity in spiking neural networks. We propose that inherent stochasticity enables synaptic plasticity to carry out probabilistic inference by sampling from a posterior distribution of synaptic parameters. This view provides a viable alternative to existing models that propose convergence of synaptic weights to maximum likelihood parameters. It explains how priors on weight distributions and connection probabilities can be merged optimally with learned experience. In simulations we show that our model for synaptic plasticity allows spiking neural networks to compensate continuously for unforeseen disturbances. Furthermore it provides a normative mathematical framework to better understand the permanent variability and rewiring observed in brain networks.
"Accelerated Proximal Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Programming. Nonconvex and nonsmooth problems have recently received considerable attention in signal/image processing, statistics and machine learning. However, solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems remains a big challenge. Accelerated proximal gradient (APG) is an excellent method for convex programming. However, it is still unknown whether the usual APG can ensure the convergence to a critical point in nonconvex programming. To address this issue, we introduce a monitor-corrector step and extend APG for general nonconvex and nonsmooth programs. Accordingly, we propose a monotone APG and a non-monotone APG. The latter waives the requirement on monotonic reduction of the objective function and needs less computation in each iteration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide APG-type algorithms for general nonconvex and nonsmooth problems ensuring that every accumulation point is a critical point, and the convergence rates remain $O(1/k^2)$ when the problems are convex, in which k is the number of iterations. Numerical results testify to the advantage of our algorithms in speed."
"Approximating Sparse PCA from Incomplete Data. We study how well one can recover sparse principal componentsof a data matrix using a sketch formed from a few of its elements. We show that for a wide class of optimization problems,if the sketch is close (in the spectral norm) to the original datamatrix, then one can recover a near optimal solution to the optimizationproblem by using the sketch. In particular, we use this approach toobtain sparse principal components and show that for \math{m} data pointsin \math{n} dimensions,\math{O(\epsilon^{-2}\tilde k\max\{m,n\})} elements gives an\math{\epsilon}-additive approximation to the sparse PCA problem(\math{\tilde k} is the stable rank of the data matrix).We demonstrate our algorithms extensivelyon image, text, biological and financial data.The results show that not only are we able to recover the sparse PCAs from the incomplete data, but by using our sparse sketch, the running timedrops by a factor of five or more."
"Nonparametric von Mises Estimators for Entropies, Divergences and Mutual Informations. We propose and analyse estimators for statistical functionals of one or moredistributions under nonparametric assumptions.Our estimators are derived from the von Mises expansion andare based on the theory of influence functions, which appearin the semiparametric statistics literature.We show that estimators based either on data-splitting or a leave-one-out techniqueenjoy fast rates of convergence and other favorable theoretical properties.We apply this framework to derive estimators for several popular informationtheoretic quantities, and via empirical evaluation, show the advantage of thisapproach over existing estimators."
Column Selection via Adaptive Sampling. Selecting a good column (or row) subset of massive data matrices has found many applications in data analysis and machine learning. We propose a new adaptive sampling algorithm that can be used to improve any relative-error column selection algorithm.  Our algorithm delivers a tighter theoretical bound on the approximation error which we also demonstrate empirically using two well known relative-error column subset selection algorithms. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm outperforms non-adaptive sampling as well as prior adaptive sampling approaches.
"HONOR: Hybrid Optimization for NOn-convex Regularized problems. Recent years have witnessed the superiority of non-convex sparse learning formulations over their convex counterparts in both theory and practice. However, due to the non-convexity and non-smoothness of the regularizer, how to efficiently solve the non-convex optimization problem for large-scale data is still quite challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient \underline{H}ybrid \underline{O}ptimization algorithm for \underline{NO}n convex \underline{R}egularized problems (HONOR). Specifically, we develop a hybrid scheme which effectively integrates a Quasi-Newton (QN) step and a Gradient Descent (GD) step. Our contributions are as follows: (1) HONOR incorporates the second-order information to greatly speed up the convergence, while it avoids solving a regularized quadratic programming and only involves matrix-vector multiplications without explicitly forming the inverse Hessian matrix. (2)  We establish a rigorous convergence analysis for HONOR, which shows that convergence is guaranteed even for non-convex problems, while it is typically challenging to analyze the convergence for non-convex problems. (3) We conduct empirical studies on large-scale data sets and results demonstrate that HONOR converges significantly faster than state-of-the-art algorithms."
"3D Object Proposals for Accurate Object Class Detection. The goal of this paper is to generate high-quality 3D object proposals in the context of autonomous driving. Our method exploits stereo imagery to  place proposals in the form of 3D bounding boxes. We formulate the problem as minimizing an energy function encoding object size priors,  ground plane as well as several depth informed features that reason about free space, point cloud densities and distance to the ground.  Our experiments  show significant performance gains over existing RGB and RGB-D object proposal methods  on the challenging KITTI benchmark. Combined with convolutional neural net (CNN) scoring, our approach outperforms all existing results on all three KITTI object classes."
"Algorithms with Logarithmic or Sublinear Regret for  Constrained Contextual Bandits. We study contextual bandits with budget and time constraints under discrete contexts, referred to as constrained contextual bandits. The time and budget constraints significantly complicate the exploration and exploitation tradeoff because they introduce complex coupling among contexts over time. To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems with known context distribution. When the expected rewards are known, we develop an approximation of the oracle, referred to Adaptive-Linear-Programming(ALP), which achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. With these highly desirable features,  we  then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown a priori. We show that the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except in certain boundary cases.Further, we design algorithms and obtain similar regret analysis results for  more general systems with unknown context distribution or heterogeneous costs.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the  first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits. Moreover, this work also sheds light on the study of computationally efficient algorithms for general constrained contextual bandits."
"Tensorizing Neural Networks. Deep neural networks currently demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in several domains.At the same time, models of this class are very demanding in terms of computational resources. In particular, a large amount of memory is required by commonly used fully-connected layers, making it hard to use the models on low-end devices and stopping the further increase of the model size. In this paper we convert the dense weight matrices of the fully-connected layers to the Tensor Train format such that the number of parameters is reduced by a huge factor and at the same time the expressive power of the layer is preserved.In particular, for the Very Deep VGG networks we report the compression factor of the dense weight matrix of a fully-connected layer up to 200000 times leading to the compression factor of the whole network up to 7 times."
"Parallelizing MCMC with Random Partition Trees. The modern scale of data has brought new challenges to Bayesian inference. In particular, conventional MCMC algorithms are computationally very expensive for large data sets.  A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies random partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is distribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We provide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating empirical performance."
"A Reduced-Dimension fMRI Shared Response Model. Multi-subject fMRI data is critical for evaluating the generality and validity of findings across subjects, and its effective utilization helps improve analysis sensitivity. We develop a shared response model for aggregating multi-subject fMRI data that accounts for different functional topographies among anatomically aligned datasets. Our model demonstrates improved sensitivity in identifying a shared response for a variety of datasets and anatomical brain regions of interest. Furthermore, by removing the identified shared response, it allows improved detection of group differences. The ability to identify what is shared and what is not shared opens the model to a wide range of multi-subject fMRI studies."
"Spectral Learning of Large Structured HMMs for Comparative Epigenomics. We develop a latent variable model and an efficient spectral algorithm motivated by the recent emergence of very large data sets of chromatin marks from multiple human cell types. A natural model for chromatin data in one cell type is a Hidden Markov Model (HMM); we model the relationship between multiple cell types by connecting their hidden states by a fixed tree of known structure. The main challenge with learning parameters of such models is that iterative methods such as EM are very slow, while naive spectral methods result in time and space complexity exponential in the number of cell types. We exploit properties of the tree structure of the hidden states to provide spectral algorithms that are more computationally efficient for current biological datasets. We provide sample complexity bounds for our algorithm and evaluate it experimentally on biological data from nine human cell types. Finally, we show that beyond our specific model, some of our algorithmic ideas can be applied to other graphical models."
"Individual Planning in Infinite-Horizon Multiagent Settings: Inference, Structure and Scalability. This  paper  provides  the first  formalization  of  self-interested planning in multiagent settings using expectation-maximization (EM). Our   formalization  in   the   context   of  infinite-horizon   and finitely-nested interactive  POMDPs (I-POMDP) is  distinct from EM formulations  for POMDPs  and cooperative  multiagent planning frameworks.  We  exploit the graphical model structure  specific to I-POMDPs, and present  a new  approach based  on block-coordinate  descent for  further speed up.  Forward  filtering-backward sampling -- a combination of exact filtering  with sampling -- is explored to exploit problem structure."
"Estimating Mixture Models via Mixtures of Polynomials. Mixture modeling is a general technique for making any simple model more expressive through weighted combination.  This generality and simplicity in part explains the success of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in which updates are easy to derive for a wide class of mixture models.  However, the likelihood of a mixture model is non-convex, so EM has no known global convergence guarantees.  Recently, method of moments approaches offer global guarantees for some mixture models, but they do not extend easily to the range of mixture models that exist.  In this work, we present Polymom, an unifying framework based on method of moments in which estimation procedures are easily derivable, just as in EM. Polymom is applicable when the moments of a single mixture component are polynomials of the parameters. Our key observation is that the moments of the mixture model are a mixture of these polynomials, which allows us to cast estimation as a Generalized Moment Problem.  We solve its relaxations using semidefinite optimization, and then extract parameters using ideas from computer algebra.  This framework allows us to draw insights and apply tools from convex optimization, computer algebra and the theory of moments to study problems in statistical estimation.  Simulations show good empirical performance on several models."
"On the Global Linear Convergence of Frank-Wolfe Optimization Variants. The Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm has lately re-gained popularity thanks in particular to its ability to nicely handle the structured constraints appearing in machine learning applications. However, its convergence rate is known to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple less-known fix is to add the possibility to take `away steps' during optimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility oracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that has been successfully applied in practice: FW with away steps, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe's minimum norm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global linear convergence under a weaker condition than strong convexity. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation as the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel geometric quantity that plays the role of the `condition number' of the constraint set. We provide pointers to where these algorithms have made a difference in practice, in particular with the flow polytope, the marginal polytope and the base polytope for submodular optimization."
"Deep Knowledge Tracing. Knowledge tracing, where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework, is an established and significantly unsolved problem in computer supported education.In this paper we explore the benefit of using recurrent neural networks to model student learning.This family of models have important advantages over current state of the art methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge,and have a far more flexible functional form which can capture substantially more complex student interactions.We show that these neural networks outperform the current state of the art in prediction on real student data,while allowing straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in the curriculum.These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing."
"Rethinking LDA: Moment Matching for Discrete ICA. We consider moment matching techniques for estimation in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). By drawing explicit links between LDA and discrete versions of independent component analysis (ICA), we first derive a new set of cumulant-based tensors, with an improved sample complexity. Moreover, we reuse standard ICA techniques such as joint diagonalization of tensors to improve over existing methods based on the tensor power method. In an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we show that our new combination of tensors and orthogonal joint diagonalization techniques outperforms existing moment matching methods."
"Efficient Compressive Phase Retrieval with Constrained Sensing Vectors. We propose a robust and efficient approach to the problem of compressive phase retrieval in which the goal is to reconstruct a sparse vector from the magnitude of a number of its linear measurements. The proposed framework relies on constrained sensing vectors and a two-stage reconstruction method that consists of two standard convex programs that are solved sequentially.In recent years, various methods are proposed for compressive phase retrieval, but they have suboptimal sample complexity or lack robustness guarantees. The main obstacle has been that there is no straightforward convex relaxations for the type of structure in the target. Given a set of underdetermined measurements, there is a standard framework for recovering a sparse matrix, and a standard framework for recovering a low-rank matrix. However, a general, efficient method for recovering a jointly sparse and low-rank matrix has remained elusive.Deviating from the models with generic measurements, in this paper we show that if the sensing vectors are chosen at random from an incoherent subspace, then the low-rank and sparse structures of the target signal can be effectively decoupled. We show that a recovery algorithm that consists of a low-rank recovery stage followed by a sparse recovery stage will produce an accurate estimate of the target when the number of measurements is $\mathsf{O}(k\,\log\frac{d}{k})$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the sparsity level and the dimension of the input signal. We also evaluate the algorithm through numerical simulation."
"Barrier Frank-Wolfe for Marginal Inference. We introduce a globally-convergent algorithm for optimizing the tree-reweighted (TRW) variational objective over the marginal polytope. The algorithm is based on the conditional gradient method (Frank-Wolfe) and moves pseudomarginals within the marginal polytope through repeated maximum a posteriori (MAP) calls. This modular structure enables us to leverage black-box MAP solvers (both exact and approximate) for variational inference, and obtains more accurate results than tree-reweighted algorithms that optimize over the local consistency relaxation. Theoretically, we bound the sub-optimality for the proposed algorithm despite the TRW objective having unbounded gradients at the boundary of the marginal polytope. Empirically, we demonstrate the increased quality of results found by tightening the relaxation over the marginal polytope as well as the spanning tree polytope on synthetic and real-world instances."
Learning Theory and Algorithms for Forecasting Non-stationary Time Series. We present data-dependent learning bounds for the general scenario of non-stationary non-mixing stochastic processes. Our learning guarantees are expressed in terms of a data-dependent measure of sequential complexity and a discrepancy measure that can be estimated from data under some mild assumptions. We use our learning bounds to devise new algorithms for non-stationary time series forecasting for which we report some preliminary experimental results.
"Compressive spectral embedding: sidestepping the SVD. Spectral embedding based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a widely used preprocessing step in many learning tasks, typically leading to dimensionality reduction by projecting onto a number of dominant singular vectors and rescaling the coordinate axes (by a predefined function of the singular value). However, the number of such vectors required to capture problem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity it compressive spectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order polynomial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an m times n matrix with T non-zeros, its time complexity is O((T+m+n)log(m+n)), and the embedding dimension is O(log(m+n)), both of which are independent of the number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to sidestepping the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks such as clustering and classification, we are only interested in using the resulting embedding to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the euclidean norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on arbitrary vectors as a partial SVD tries to do. Our numerical results on network datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, and motivate further exploration of its application to large-scale inference tasks."
"A Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Low Rank Matrix Estimation. We study the estimation of low rank matrices via nonconvex optimization. Compared with convex relaxation, nonconvex optimization exhibits superior empirical performance for large scale instances of low rank matrix estimation. However, the understanding of its theoretical guarantees are limited. In this paper, we define the notion of projected oracle divergence based on which we establish sufficient conditions for the success of nonconvex optimization. We illustrate the consequences of this general framework for matrix sensing and completion. In particular, we prove that a broad class of nonconvex optimization algorithms, including alternating minimization and gradient-type methods, geometrically converge to the global optimum and exactly recover the true low rank matrices under standard conditions."
"Automatic Variational Inference in Stan. Variational inference is a scalable technique for approximate Bayesian inference.  Deriving variational inference algorithms requires tedious model-specific calculations; this makes it difficult for non-experts to use.  We propose an automatic variational inference algorithm, automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI); we implement it in Stan (code available), a probabilistic programming system.  In ADVI the user provides a Bayesian model and a dataset, nothing else.  We make no conjugacy assumptions and support a broad class of models. The algorithm automatically determines an appropriate variational family and optimizes the variational objective. We compare ADVI to MCMC sampling across hierarchical generalized linear models, nonconjugate matrix factorization, and a mixture model. We train the mixture model on a quarter million images.  With ADVI we can use variational inference on any model we write in Stan."
"Attention-Based Models for Speech Recognition. Recurrent sequence generators conditioned on input data through an attention mechanism have recently shown very good performance on a range of tasks including machine translation, handwriting synthesis and image caption generation. We extend the attention-mechanism with features needed for speech recognition. We show that while an adaptation of the model used for machine translation reaches a competitive 18.6\% phoneme error rate (PER) on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, it can only be applied to utterances which are roughly as long as the ones it was trained on. We offer a qualitative explanation of this failure and propose a novel and generic method of adding location-awareness to the attention mechanism to alleviate this issue. The new method yields a model that is robust to long inputs and achieves 18\% PER in single utterances and 20\% in 10-times longer (repeated) utterances.  Finally, we propose a change to the attention mechanism that prevents it from concentrating too much on single frames, which further reduces PER to 17.6\% level."
"Closed-form Estimators for High-dimensional Generalized Linear Models. We propose a class of closed-form estimators for GLMs under high-dimensional sampling regimes. Our class of estimators is based on deriving closed-form variants of the vanilla unregularized MLE but which are (a) well-defined even under high-dimensional settings, and (b) available in closed-form. We then perform thresholding operations on this MLE variant to obtain our class of estimators. We derive a unified statistical analysis of our class of estimators, and show that it enjoys strong statistical guarantees in both parameter error as well as variable selection, that surprisingly match those of the more complex regularized GLM MLEs, even while our closed-form estimators are computationally much simpler. We derive instantiations of our class of closed-form estimators, as well as corollaries of our general theorem, for the special cases of logistic, exponential and Poisson regression models. We corroborate the surprising statistical and computational performance of our class of estimators via extensive simulations."
"Online F-Measure Optimization. The F-measure is an important and commonly used performance metric for binary prediction tasks. By combining precision and recall into a single score, it avoids disadvantages of simple metrics like the error rate, especially in cases of imbalanced class distributions. The problem of optimizing the F-measure, that is, of developing learning algorithms that perform optimally in the sense of this measure, has recently been tackled by several authors. In this paper, we study the problem of F-measure maximization in the setting of online learning. We propose an efficient online algorithm and provide a formal analysis of its convergence properties. Moreover, first experimental results are presented, showing that our method performs well in practice."
"Online Rank Elicitation for Plackett-Luce: A Dueling Bandits Approach. We study the problem of online rank elicitation, assuming that rankings of a set of alternatives obey the Plackett-Luce distribution. Following the setting of the dueling bandits problem, the learner is allowed to query pairwise comparisons between alternatives, i.e., to sample pairwise marginals of the distribution in an online fashion. Using this information, the learner seeks to reliably predict the most probable ranking (or top-alternative). Our approach is based on constructing a surrogate probability distribution over rankings based on a sorting procedure, for which the pairwise marginals provably coincide with the marginals of the Plackett-Luce distribution. In addition to a formal performance and complexity analysis, we present first experimental studies."
"M-Best-Diverse Labelings for Submodular Energies and Beyond. We consider the problem of finding M best diverse solutions of energy minimization problems for graphical models. Contrary to the sequential method of Batra et al., which greedily finds one solution after another, we infer all $M$ solutions jointly. It was shown recently that such jointly inferred labelings not only have smaller total energy but also qualitatively outperform the sequentially obtained ones. The only obstacle for using this new technique is the complexity of the corresponding inference problem, since it is considerably slower algorithm than the method of Batra et al. In this work we show that the joint inference of $M$ best diverse solutions can be formulated as a submodular energy minimization if the original MAP-inference problem is submodular, hence fast inference techniques can be used. In addition to the theoretical results we provide practical algorithms that outperform the current state-of-the art and can be used in both submodular and non-submodular case."
"Tractable Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Bounded Vertex Cover Number. Both learning and inference tasks on Bayesian networks are NP-hard in general. Bounded tree-width Bayesian networks have recently received a lot of attention as a way to circumvent this complexity issue; however, while inference on bounded tree-width networks is tractable, the learning problem remains NP-hard even for tree-width~2. In this paper, we propose bounded vertex cover number Bayesian networks as an alternative to bounded tree-width networks. In particular, we show that both inference and learning can be done in polynomial time for any fixed vertex cover number bound $k$, in contrast to the general and bounded tree-width cases; on the other hand, we also show that learning problem is W[1]-hard in parameter $k$. Furthermore, we give an alternative way to learn bounded vertex cover number Bayesian networks using integer linear programming (ILP),  and show this is feasible in practice."
"Learning Large-Scale Poisson DAG Models based on OverDispersion Scoring. In this paper, we address the question of identifiability and learning algorithms for large-scale Poisson Directed Acyclic Graphical (DAG) models. We define general Poisson DAG models as models where each node is a Poisson random variable with rate parameter depending on the values of the parents in the underlying DAG. First, we prove that Poisson DAG models are identifiable from observational data, and present a polynomial-time algorithm that learns the Poisson DAG model under suitable regularity conditions. The main idea behind our algorithm is based on overdispersion, in that variables that are conditionally Poisson are overdispersed relative to variables that are marginally Poisson. Our algorithms exploits overdispersion along with methods for learning sparse Poisson undirected graphical models for faster computation. We provide both theoretical guarantees and simulation results for both small and large-scale DAGs."
"Training Restricted Boltzmann Machine via the ￼Thouless-Anderson-Palmer free energy. Restricted Boltzmann machines are undirected neural networks which have been shown tobe effective in many applications, including serving as initializations fortraining deep multi-layer neural networks. One of the main reasons for their success is theexistence of efficient and practical stochastic algorithms, such as contrastive divergence,for unsupervised training. We propose an alternative deterministic iterative procedure based on an improved mean field method from statistical physics known as the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer approach. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides performance equal to, and sometimes superior to, persistent contrastive divergence, while also providing a clear and easy to evaluate objective function. We believe that this strategycan be easily generalized to other models as well as to more accurate higher-order approximations, paving the way for systematic improvements in training Boltzmann machineswith hidden units."
"Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks."
"Robust Feature-Sample Linear Discriminant Analysis for Brain Disorders Diagnosis. A wide spectrum of discriminative methods is increasingly used  in diverse applications for classification or regression tasks. However, many existing discriminative methods assume that the input data is nearly noise-free, which limits their applications to solve real-world problems. Particularly for disease diagnosis, the data acquired by the neuroimaging devices are always prone to different sources of noise. Robust discriminative models are somewhat scarce and only a few attempts have been made to make them robust against noise or outliers. These methods focus on detecting either the sample-outliers or feature-noises. Moreover, they usually use unsupervised de-noising procedures, or separately de-noise the training and the testing data. All these factors may induce biases in the learning process, and thus limit its performance. In this paper, we propose a classification method based on the least-squares formulation of linear discriminant analysis, which simultaneously detects the sample-outliers and feature-noises. The proposed method operates under a semi-supervised setting, in which both labeled training and unlabeled testing data are incorporated to form the intrinsic geometry of the sample space. Therefore, the violating samples or feature values are identified  as sample-outliers or feature-noises, respectively. We test our algorithm on one synthetic and two brain neurodegenerative databases (particularly for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms all baseline and state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both accuracy and the area under the ROC curve."
"Black-box optimization of noisy functions with unknown smoothness. We study the problem of black-box optimization of a function $f$ of any dimension, given function evaluations perturbed by noise. The function is assumed to be locally smooth around one of its global optima, but this smoothness is unknown. Our contribution is an adaptive optimization algorithm, POO or parallel optimistic optimization, that is able to deal with this setting. POO performs almost as well as the best known algorithms requiring the knowledge of the smoothness. Furthermore, POO works for a larger class of functions than what was previously considered, especially for functions that are difficult to optimize, in a very precise sense. We provide a finite-time analysis of  POO's performance, which shows that its error after $n$ evaluations is at most a factor of $\sqrt{\ln n}$ away from the error of the best known optimization algorithms using the knowledge of the smoothness."
"Recovering Communities in the General Stochastic Block Model Without Knowing the Parameters. The stochastic block model (SBM) has recently gathered significant attention due to new threshold phenomena. However, most developments rely on the knowledge of the model parameters, or at least on the number of communities. This paper introduces efficient algorithms that do not require such knowledge and yet achieve the optimal information-theoretic tradeoffs identified in Abbe-Sandon FOCS15. In the constant degree regime, an algorithm is developed that requires only a lower-bound on the relative sizes of the communities and achieves the optimal accuracy scaling for large degrees. This lower-bound requirement is removed for the regime of arbitrarily slowly diverging degrees, and the model parameters are learned efficiently. For the logarithmic degree regime, this is further enhanced into a fully agnostic algorithm that achieves the CH-limit for exact recovery in quasi-linear time. These provide the first algorithms affording efficiency, universality and information-theoretic optimality for strong and weak consistency in the SBM."
"Deep learning with Elastic Averaging SGD. We study the problem of stochastic optimization for deep learning in the parallel computing environment under communication constraints. A new algorithm is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural networks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm accelerates the training of deep architectures compared to DOWNPOUR and other common baseline approaches and furthermore is very communication efficient."
"Monotone k-Submodular Function Maximization with Size Constraints. A $k$-submodular function is a generalization of a submodular function, where the input consists of $k$ disjoint subsets, instead of a single subset, of the domain.Many machine learning problems, including influence maximization with $k$ kinds of topics and sensor placement with $k$ kinds of sensors, can be naturally modeled as the problem of maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions.In this paper, we give constant-factor approximation algorithms for maximizing monotone $k$-submodular functions subject to several size constraints.The running time of our algorithms are almost linear in the domain size.We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithms outperform baseline algorithms in terms of the solution quality."
"Active Learning from Weak and Strong Labelers. An active learner is given a hypothesis class, a large set of unlabeled examples and the ability to interactively query labels to an oracle of a subset of these examples; the goal of the learner is to learn a hypothesis in the class that fits the data well by making as few label queries as possible.This work addresses active learning with labels obtained from strong and weak labelers, where in addition to the standard active learning setting, we have an extra weak labeler which may occasionally provide incorrect labels. An example is learning to classify medical images where either expensive labels may be obtained from a physician (oracle or strong labeler), or cheaper but occasionally incorrect labels may be obtained from a medical resident (weak labeler). Our goal is to learn a classifier with low error on data labeled by the oracle, while using the weak labeler to reduce the number of label queries made to this labeler. We provide an active learning algorithm for this setting, establish its statistical consistency, and analyze its label complexity to characterize when it can provide label savings over using the strong labeler alone."
"On the Optimality of Classifier Chain for Multi-label Classification. To capture the interdependencies between labels in multi-label classification problems, classifier chain (CC)  tries to take the multiple labels of each instance into account under a deterministic high-order Markov Chain model. Since its  performance is sensitive to the choice of label order, the key issue is how to determine the optimal label order for CC. In this work, we first generalize the CC model over a random label order. Then, we present a theoretical analysis of the generalization error for the proposed generalized model. Based on our results, we propose a dynamic programming based classifier chain (CC-DP) algorithm to search the globally optimal label order for CC and a greedy classifier chain (CC-Greedy) algorithm to find a locally optimal CC. Comprehensive experiments on a number of real-world multi-label data sets from various domains demonstrate that our proposed CC-DP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and the CC-Greedy algorithm achieves comparable prediction performance with CC-DP."
"Robust Regression via Hard Thresholding. We study the problem of Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) where several response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a data matrix X \in \R^{p x n} and an underlying model w*, the response vector is generated as y = X'w* + b where b \in n is the corruption vector supported over at most C.n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus solely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected independently of X.In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT which, under mild conditions on X, can recover w* exactly even if b corrupts the response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and entries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w*. Our results hold under deterministic assumptions which are satisfied if X is sampled from any sub-Gaussian distribution. Finally unlike existing results that apply only to a fixed w*, generated independently of X, our results are universal and hold for any w* \in \R^p.Next, we propose gradient descent-based extensions of TORRENT that can scale efficiently to large scale problems, such as high dimensional sparse recovery. and prove similar recovery guarantees for these extensions. Empirically we find TORRENT, and more so its extensions, offering significantly faster recovery than the state-of-the-art L1 solvers. For instance, even on moderate-sized datasets (with p = 50K) with around 40% corrupted responses, a variant of our proposed method called TORRENT-HYB is more than 20x faster than the best L1 solver."
"Sparse Local Embeddings for Extreme Multi-label Classification. The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to train a classifier that can automatically tag a novel data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Embedding based approaches make training and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and hence the effective number of labels can be reduced by projecting the high dimensional label vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding approaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies or scale to large problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications.This paper develops the SLEEC classifier to address both limitations. The main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensemble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infrequently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional low-rank assumption and boost classification accuracy by learning embeddings which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors. We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world as well as benchmark data sets and compare our method against state-of-the-art methods for extreme multi-label classification. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make significantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both embeddings (by as much as 35%) as well as trees (by as much as 6%). SLEEC can also scale efficiently to data sets with a million labels which are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods."
"Solving Random Quadratic Systems of Equations Is Nearly as Easy as Solving Linear Systems. This paper is concerned with finding a solution x to a quadratic system of equations y_i = |< a_i, x >|^2,  i = 1, 2, ..., m. We prove that it is possible to solve unstructured quadratic systems in n variables exactly from O(n) equations in linear time, that is, in time proportional to reading and evaluating the data. This is accomplished by a novel procedure, which starting from an initial guess given by a spectral initialization procedure, attempts to minimize a non-convex objective. The proposed algorithm distinguishes from prior approaches by regularizing the initialization and descent procedures in an adaptive fashion, which discard terms bearing too much influence on the initial estimate or search directions. These careful selection rules---which effectively serve as a variance reduction scheme---provide a tighter initial guess, more robust descent directions, and thus enhanced practical performance. Further, this procedure also achieves a near-optimal statistical accuracy in the presence of noise. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the computational cost of our algorithm is about four times that of solving a least-squares problem of the same size."
"A Framework for Individualizing Predictions of Disease Trajectories by Exploiting Multi-Resolution Structure. For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy."
"Subspace Clustering with Irrelevant Features via Robust Dantzig Selector. This paper considers the subspace clustering problem where the data contains irrelevant or corrupted features. We propose a method termed ``robust Dantzig selector'' which can successfully identify the clustering structure even with the presence of irrelevant features. The idea is simple yet powerful: we replace the inner product by its robust counterpart, which is insensitive to the irrelevant features given an upper bound of the number of irrelevant features. We establish theoretical guarantees for the algorithm to identify the correct subspace, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm via numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method developed to tackle subspace clustering with irrelevant features."
"Sparse PCA via Bipartite Matchings. We consider the following multi-component sparse PCA problem:given a set of data points, we seek to extract a small number of sparse components with \emph{disjoint} supports that jointly capture the maximum possible variance.Such components can be computed one by one, repeatedly solving the single-component problem and deflating the input data matrix, but this greedy procedure is suboptimal.We present a novel algorithm for sparse PCA that jointly optimizes multiple disjoint components. The extracted features capture variance that lies within a multiplicative factor arbitrarily close to $1$ from the optimal.Our algorithm is combinatorial and computes the desired components by solving multiple instances of the bipartite maximum weight matching problem.Its complexity grows as a low order polynomial in the ambient dimension of the input data, but exponentially in its rank.However, it can be effectively applied on a low-dimensional sketch of the input data.We evaluate our algorithm on real datasets and empirically demonstrate that in many cases it outperforms existing, deflation-based approaches."
"Fast Randomized Kernel Ridge Regression with Statistical Guarantees. One approach to improving the running time of kernel-based methods is to build a small sketch of the kernel matrix and use it in lieu of the full matrix in the machine learning task of interest. Here, we describe a version of this approach that comes with running time guarantees as well as improved guarantees on its statistical performance.By extending the notion of \emph{statistical leverage scores} to the setting of kernel ridge regression, we are able to identify a sampling distribution that reduces the size of the sketch (i.e., the required number of columns to be sampled) to the \emph{effective dimensionality} of the problem.  This latter quantity is often much smaller than previous bounds that depend on the \emph{maximal degrees of freedom}. We give an empirical evidence supporting this fact. Our second contribution is to present a fast algorithm to quickly compute coarse approximations to thesescores in time linear in the number of samples. More precisely, the running time of the algorithm is $O(np^2)$ with $p$ only depending on the trace of the kernel matrix and the regularization parameter. This is obtained via a variant of squared length sampling that we adapt to the kernel setting. Lastly, we discuss how this new notion of the leverage of a data point captures a fine notion of the difficulty of the learning problem."
"Online Learning for Adversaries with Memory: Price of Past Mistakes. The framework of online learning with memory naturally captures learning problems with temporal effects, and was previously studied for the experts setting. In this work we extend the notion of learning with memory to the general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) framework, and present two algorithms that attain low regret. The first algorithm applies to Lipschitz continuous loss functions, obtaining optimal regret bounds for both convex and strongly convex losses. The second algorithm attains the optimal regret bounds and applies more broadly to convex losses without requiring Lipschitz continuity, yet is more complicated to implement. We complement the theoretic results with two applications: statistical arbitrage in finance, and multi-step ahead prediction in statistics."
"Convolutional spike-triggered covariance analysis for neural subunit models. Subunit models provide a powerful yet parsimonious description of  neural spike responses to complex stimuli. They can be expressed by  a cascade of two linear-nonlinear (LN) stages, with the first linear  stage defined by convolution with one or more filters.  Recent  interest in such models has surged due to their biological  plausibility and accuracy for characterizing early sensory  responses. However, fitting subunit models poses a difficult  computational challenge due to the expense of evaluating the  log-likelihood and the ubiquity of local optima.  Here we address  this problem by forging a theoretical connection between  spike-triggered covariance analysis and nonlinear subunit models.  Specifically, we show that a ''convolutional'' decomposition of the  spike-triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) provides an  asymptotically efficient estimator for the subunit model under  certain technical conditions. We also prove the identifiability of  such convolutional decomposition under mild assumptions.  Our  moment-based methods outperform highly regularized versions of the  GQM on neural data from macaque primary visual cortex, and achieves  nearly the same prediction performance as the full  maximum-likelihood estimator, yet with substantially lower cost."
"Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting. The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting."
"GAP Safe screening rules for sparse multi-task and multi-class models. High dimensional regression benefits from sparsity promoting regularizations. Screening rules leverage the known sparsity of the solution by ignoring some variables in the optimization, hence speeding up solvers. When the procedure is proven not to discard features wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this paper we derive new safe rules for generalized linear models regularized with L1 and L1/L2 norms. The rules are based on duality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero. This allows to discard safely more variables, in particular for low regularization parameters. The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance on coordinate descent for multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe rules."
"Empirical Localization of Homogeneous Divergences on Discrete Sample Spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter estimator for probabilistic models on discrete space. The proposed estimator is derived from minimization of homogeneous divergence and can be constructed without calculation of the normalization constant, which is frequently infeasible for models in the discrete space. We investigate statistical properties of the proposed estimator such as consistency and asymptotic normality, and reveal a relationship with the alpha-divergence. Small experiments show that the proposed estimator attains comparable performance to the MLE with drastically lower computational cost."
"Statistical Model Criticism using Kernel Two Sample Tests. We propose an exploratory approach to statistical model criticism using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) two sample tests. Typical approaches to model criticism require a practitioner to select a statistic by which to measure discrepancies between data and a statistical model. MMD two sample tests are instead constructed as an analytic maximisation over a large space of possible statistics and therefore automatically select the statistic which most shows any discrepancy. We demonstrate on synthetic data that the selected statistic, called the witness function, can be used to identify where a statistical model most misrepresents the data it was trained on. We then apply the procedure to real data where the models being assessed are restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks and Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the ways in which these models fail to capture the properties of the data they are trained on."
"Precision-Recall-Gain Curves: PR Analysis Done Right. Precision-Recall analysis abounds in applications of binary classification where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the classifier's performance. Perhaps inspired by the many advantages of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under such curves for accuracy-based performance assessment, many researchers have taken to report Precision-Recall (PR) curves and associated areas as performance metric. We demonstrate in this paper that this practice is fraught with difficulties, mainly because of incoherent scale assumptions -- e.g., the area under a PR curve takes the arithmetic mean of precision values whereas the $F_{\beta}$ score applies the harmonic mean. We show how to fix this by plotting PR curves in a different coordinate system, and demonstrate that the new Precision-Recall-Gain curves inherit all key advantages of ROC curves. In particular, the area under Precision-Recall-Gain curves conveys an expected $F_1$ score on a harmonic scale, and the convex hull of a Precision-Recall-Gain curve allows us to calibrate the classifier's scores so as to determine, for each operating point on the convex hull, the interval of $\beta$ values for which the point optimises $F_{\beta}$. We demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR curves can easily favour models with lower expected $F_1$ score than others, and so the use of Precision-Recall-Gain curves will result in better model selection."
"A Generalization of Submodular Cover via the Diminishing Return Property on the Integer Lattice. We consider a generalization of the submodular cover problem based on the concept of diminishing return property on the integer lattice. We are motivated by real scenarios in machine learning that cannot be captured by (traditional) submodular set functions.  We show that the generalized submodular cover problem can be applied to various problems and devise a bicriteria approximation algorithm.  Our algorithm is guaranteed to output a log-factor approximate solution that satisfies the constraints with the desired accuracy. The running time of our algorithm is roughly $O(n\log (nr) \log{r})$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $r$ is the maximum value of a coordinate.  The dependency on $r$ is exponentially better than the naive reduction algorithms. Several experiments on real and artificial datasets demonstrate that the solution quality of our algorithm is comparable to naive algorithms, while the running time is several orders of magnitude faster."
"Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks as Generative Models. Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) are trained to predict both in the positive and negative time directions simultaneously. They have not been used commonly in unsupervised tasks, because a probabilistic interpretation of the model has been difficult. Recently, two different frameworks, GSN and NADE, provide a connection between reconstruction and probabilistic modeling, which makes the interpretation possible. As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have been studied in the context of time series before.As an example of an unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently. Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed methods."
"Quartz: Randomized Dual Coordinate Ascent with Arbitrary Sampling. We study the problem of minimizing the average of a large number of smooth convex functions penalized with a strongly convex regularizer. We propose and analyze a novel primal-dual method (Quartz) which at every iteration samples and updates a random subset of the dual variables, chosen according to an arbitrary distribution. In contrast to typical analysis, we directly bound the decrease of the primal-dual error (in expectation), without the need to first analyze the dual error. Depending on the choice of the sampling, we obtain efficient serial and mini-batch variants of the method. In the serial case, our bounds match the best known bounds for SDCA (both with uniform and importance sampling). With standard mini-batching, our bounds predict initial data-independent speedup as well as additional data-driven speedup which depends on spectral and sparsity properties of the data."
"Maximum Likelihood Learning With Arbitrary Treewidth via Fast-Mixing Parameter Sets. Inference is typically intractable in high-treewidth undirected graphical models, making maximum likelihood learning a challenge. One way to overcome this is to restrict parameters to a tractable set, most typically the set of tree-structured parameters. This paper explores an alternative notion of a tractable set, namely a set of “fast-mixing parameters” where Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference can be guaranteed to quickly converge to the stationary distribution. While it is common in practice to approximate the likelihood gradient using samples obtained from MCMC, such procedures lack theoretical guarantees. This paper proves that for any exponential family with bounded sufficient statistics, (not just graphical models) when parameters are constrained to a fast-mixing set, gradient descent with gradients approximated by sampling will approximate the maximum likelihood solution inside the set with high-probability. When unregularized, to find a solution epsilon-accurate in log-likelihood requires a total amount of effort cubic in 1/epsilon, disregarding logarithmic factors. When ridge-regularized, strong convexity allows a solution epsilon-accurate in parameter distance with an effort quadratic in 1/epsilon. Both of these provide of a fully-polynomial time randomized approximation scheme."
"Hessian-free Optimization for Learning Deep Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks. Multidimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNNs) have shown a remarkable performance in the area of speech and handwriting recognition. The performance of an MDRNN is improved by further increasing its depth, and the difficulty of learning the deeper network is overcome by using Hessian-free (HF) optimization. Given that connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is utilized as an objective of learning an MDRNN for sequence labeling, the non-convexity of  CTC poses a problem when applying HF to the network. As a solution, a convex approximation of CTC is formulated and its relationship with the EM algorithm and the Fisher information matrix is discussed. An MDRNN up to a depth of 15 layers is successfully trained using HF, resulting in an improved performance for sequence labeling."
"Large-scale probabilistic predictors with and without guarantees of validity. This paper studies theoretically and empirically a method of turning machine-learning algorithms into probabilistic predictors that automatically enjoys a property of validity (perfect calibration) and is computationally efficient. The price to pay for perfect calibration is that these probabilistic predictors produce imprecise (in practice, almost precise for large data sets) probabilities. When these imprecise probabilities are merged into precise probabilities, the resulting predictors, while losing the theoretical property of perfect calibration, are consistently more accurate than the existing methods in empirical studies."
"Shepard Convolutional Neural Networks. Deep learning has recently been introduced to the field of low-level computer vision and image processing. Promising results have been obtained in a number of tasks including super-resolution, inpainting, deconvolution, filtering, etc. However, previously adopted neural network approaches such as convolutional neural networks and sparse auto-encoders are inherently with translation invariant operators. We found this property prevents the deep learning approaches from outperforming the state-of-the-art if the task itself requires translation variant interpolation (TVI). In this paper, we draw on Shepard interpolation and design Shepard Convolutional Neural Networks (ShCNN) which efficiently realizes end-to-end trainable TVI operators in the network. We show that by adding only a few feature maps in the new Shepard layers, the network is able to achieve stronger results than a much deeper architecture. Superior performance on both image inpainting and super-resolution is obtained where our system outperforms previous ones while keeping the running time competitive."
"Matrix Manifold Optimization for Gaussian Mixtures. We take a new look at parameter estimation for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMMs). Specifically, we advance Riemannian manifold optimization (on the manifold of positive definite matrices) as a potential replacement for Expectation Maximization (EM), which has been the de facto standard for decades. An out-of-the-box invocation of Riemannian optimization, however, fails spectacularly: it obtains the same solution as EM, but vastly slower. Building on intuition from geometric convexity, we propose a simple reformulation that has remarkable consequences: it makes Riemannian optimization not only match EM (a nontrivial result on its own, given the poor record nonlinear programming has had against EM), but also outperform it in many settings. To bring our ideas to fruition, we develop a well-tuned Riemannian LBFGS method that proves superior to known competing methods (e.g., Riemannian conjugate gradient). We hope that our results encourage a wider consideration of manifold optimization in machine learning and statistics."
"Semi-supervised Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Categorization via Region Embedding. This paper presents a new semi-supervised framework with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text categorization.  Unlike the previous approaches that rely on word embeddings, our method learns embeddings of small text regions from unlabeled data for integration into a supervised CNN.  The proposed scheme for embedding learning is based on the idea of two-view semi-supervised learning, which is intended to be useful for the task of interest even though the training is done on unlabeled data.  Our models achieve better results than previous approaches on sentiment classification and topic classification tasks."
"Parallel Recursive Best-First AND/OR Search for Exact MAP Inference in Graphical Models. The paper presents and evaluates the power of parallel search for exact MAP inference in graphical models. We introduce a new parallel shared-memory recursive best-first AND/OR search algorithm, called SPRBFAOO, that explores the search space in a best-first manner while operating with restricted memory. Our experiments show that SPRBFAOO is often superior to the current state-of-the-art sequential AND/OR search approaches, leading to considerable speed-ups (up to 7-fold with 12 threads), especially on hard problem instances."
"Convolutional Neural Networks with Intra-Layer Recurrent Connections for Scene Labeling. Scene labeling is a challenging computer vision task. It requires the use of both local discriminative features and global context information. We adopt a deep recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) for this task, which is originally proposed for object recognition. Different from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), this model has intra-layer recurrent connections in the convolutional layers. Therefore each convolutional layer becomes a two-dimensional recurrent neural network. The units receive constant feed-forward inputs from the previous layer and recurrent inputs from their neighborhoods. While recurrent iterations proceed, the region of context captured by each unit expands. In this way, feature extraction and context modulation are seamlessly integrated, which is different from typical methods that entail separate modules for the two steps. To further utilize the context, a multi-scale RCNN is proposed. Over two benchmark datasets, Standford Background and Sift Flow, the model outperforms many state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency."
"Bounding the Cost of Search-Based Lifted Inference. Recently, there has been growing interest in systematic search-based and importance sampling-based lifted inference algorithms for statistical relational models (SRMs). These lifted algorithms achieve significant complexity reductions over their propositional counterparts by using lifting rules that leverage symmetries in the relational representation. One drawback of these algorithms is that they use an inference-blind representation of the search space, which makes it difficult to efficiently pre-compute tight upper bounds on the exact cost of inference without running the algorithm to completion. In this paper, we present a principled approach to address this problem. We introduce a lifted analogue of the propositional And/Or search space framework, which we call a lifted And/Or schematic. Given a schematic-based representation of an SRM, we show how to efficiently compute a tight upper bound on the time and space cost of exact inference from a current assignment and the remaining schematic. We show how our bounding method can be used within a lifted importance sampling algorithm, in order to perform effective Rao-Blackwellisation, and demonstrate experimentally that the Rao-Blackwellised version of the algorithm yields more accurate estimates on several real-world datasets."
"Gradient-free Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Efficient Kernel Exponential Families. We propose Kernel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (KMC), a gradient-free adaptive MCMC algorithm based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers. We support our claims with experimental studies on both toy and real-world applications, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and exact-approximate MCMC."
"Linear Multi-Resource Allocation with Semi-Bandit Feedback. We study an idealised sequential resource allocation problem. In each time step the learner chooses an allocation of several resource types between a number of tasks. Assigning more resources to a task increases the probability that it is completed. The problem is challenging because the alignment of the tasks to the resource types is unknown and the feedback is noisy. Our main contribution is the new setting and an algorithm with nearly-optimal regret analysis. Along the way we draw connections to the problem of minimising regret for stochastic linear bandits with heteroscedastic noise. We also present some new results for stochastic linear bandits on the hypercube that significantly out-performs existing work, especially in the sparse case."
"Unsupervised Learning by Program Synthesis. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithmthat combines probabilistic modeling with solver-based techniques for program synthesis.We apply our techniques to both a visual learning domain and a language learning problem,showing that our algorithm can learn many visual concepts from only a few examplesand that it can recover some English inflectional morphology.Taken together, these results give both a new approach to unsupervised learning of symbolic compositional structures,and a technique for applying program synthesis tools to noisy data."
"Enforcing balance allows local supervised learning in spiking recurrent networks. To predict sensory inputs or control motor trajectories, the brain must constantly learn temporal dynamics based on error feedback. However, it remains unclear how such supervised learning is implemented in biological neural networks. Learning in recurrent spiking networks is notoriously difficult because local changes in connectivity may have an unpredictable effect on the global dynamics. The most commonly used learning rules, such as temporal back-propagation, are not local and thus not biologically plausible. Furthermore, reproducing the Poisson-like statistics of neural responses requires the use of networks with balanced excitation and inhibition. Such balance is easily destroyed during learning. Using a top-down approach, we show how networks of integrate-and-fire neurons can learn arbitrary linear dynamical systems by feeding back their error as a feed-forward input. The network uses two types of recurrent connections: fast and slow. The fast connections learn to balance excitation and inhibition using a voltage-based plasticity rule. The slow connections are trained to minimize the error feedback using a current-based Hebbian learning rule. Importantly, the balance maintained by fast connections is crucial to ensure that global error signals are available locally in each neuron, in turn resulting in a local learning rule for the slow connections. This demonstrates that spiking networks can learn complex dynamics using purely local learning rules, using E/I balance as the key rather than an additional constraint. The resulting network implements a given function within the predictive coding scheme, with minimal dimensions and activity."
"Fast and Guaranteed Tensor Decomposition via Sketching. Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition has wide applications in statistical learning of latent variable models and in data mining. In this paper, we propose fast and randomized tensor CP decomposition algorithms based on sketching. We build on the idea of count sketches, but introduce many novel ideas which are unique to tensors. We develop novel methods for randomized com- putation of tensor contractions via FFTs, without explicitly forming the tensors. Such tensor contractions are encountered in decomposition methods such as ten- sor power iterations and alternating least squares. We also design novel colliding hashes for symmetric tensors to further save time in computing the sketches. We then combine these sketching ideas with existing whitening and tensor power iter- ative techniques to obtain the fastest algorithm on both sparse and dense tensors. The quality of approximation under our method does not depend on properties such as sparsity, uniformity of elements, etc. We apply the method for topic mod- eling and obtain competitive results."
"Differentially private subspace clustering. Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple ``clusters'' so that data points in a single cluster lie approximately on a low-dimensional linear subspace. It is originally motivated by 3D motion segmentation in computer vision, but has recently been generically applied to a wide range of statistical machine learning problems, which often involves sensitive datasets about human subjects. This raises a dire concern for data privacy. In this work, we build on the framework of ``differential privacy'' and present two provably private subspace clustering algorithms. We demonstrate via both theory and experiments that one of the presented methods enjoys formal privacy and utility guarantees; the other one asymptotically preserves differential privacy while having good performance in practice. Along the course of the proof, we also obtain two new provable guarantees for the agnostic subspace clustering and the graph connectivity problem which might be of independent interests."
"Predtron: A Family of Online Algorithms for General Prediction Problems. Modern prediction problems arising in multilabel learning and learning to rank pose unique challenges to the classical theory of supervised learning. These problems have large prediction and label spaces of a combinatorial nature and involve sophisticated loss functions. We offer a general framework to derive mistake driven online algorithms and associated loss bounds.  The key ingredients in our framework are a general loss function, a general vector space representation of predictions, and a notion of margin with respect to a general norm. Our general algorithm, Predtron, yields the perceptron algorithm and its variants when instantiated on classic problems such as binary classification, multiclass classification, ordinal regression, and multilabel classification.  For multilabel ranking and subset ranking, we derive novel algorithms, notions of margins, and loss bounds. A simulation study confirms the behavior predicted by our bounds and demonstrates the flexibility of the design choices in our framework."
"Weighted Theta Functions and Embeddings with Applications to Max-Cut, Clustering and Summarization. We introduce a unifying generalization of the Lovász theta function, and the associated geometric embedding, for graphs with weights on both nodes and edges. We show how it can be computed exactly by semidefinite programming, and how to approximate it using SVM computations. We show how the theta function can be interpreted as a measure of diversity in graphs and use this idea, and the graph embedding in algorithms for Max-Cut, correlation clustering and document summarization, all of which are well represented as problems on weighted graphs."
"SGD Algorithms based on Incomplete U-statistics: Large-Scale Minimization of Empirical Risk. In many learning problems, ranging from clustering to ranking through metric learning, empirical estimates of the risk functional consist of an average over tuples (e.g., pairs or triplets) of observations, rather than over individual observations. In this paper, we focus on how to best implement a stochastic approximation approach to solve such risk minimization problems. We argue that in the large-scale setting, gradient estimates should be obtained by sampling tuples of data points with replacement (incomplete U-statistics) instead of sampling data points without replacement (complete U-statistics based on subsamples). We develop a theoretical framework accounting for the substantial impact of this strategy on the generalization ability of the prediction model returned by the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. It reveals that the method we promote achieves a much better trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational cost. Beyond the rate bound analysis, experiments on AUC maximization and metric learning provide strong empirical evidence of the superiority of the proposed approach."
"On Top-k Selection in Multi-Armed Bandits and Hidden Bipartite Graphs. This paper discusses how to efficiently choose from $n$ unknowndistributions the $k$ ones whose means are the greatest by a certainmetric, up to a small relative error. We study the topic under twostandard settings---multi-armed bandits and hidden bipartitegraphs---which differ in the nature of the input distributions. In theformer setting, each distribution can be sampled (in the i.i.d.manner) an arbitrary number of times, whereas in the latter, eachdistribution is defined on a population of a finite size $m$ (andhence, is fully revealed after $m$ samples). For both settings, weprove lower bounds on the total number of samples needed, and proposeoptimal algorithms whose sample complexities match those lower bounds."
"The Brain Uses Reliability of Stimulus Information when Making Perceptual Decisions. In simple perceptual decisions the brain has to identify a stimulus based on noisy sensory samples from the stimulus. Basic statistical considerations state that the reliability of the stimulus information, i.e., the amount of noise in the samples, should be taken into account when the decision is made. However, for perceptual decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the brain indeed uses the reliability for making decisions when confronted with unpredictable changes in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic drift diffusion model, which has frequently been used to explain experimental findings in perceptual decision making, implicitly relies on estimates of stimulus reliability. We then show that only those variants of the drift diffusion model which allow stimulus-specific reliabilities are consistent with neurophysiological findings. Our analysis suggests that the brain estimates the reliability of the stimulus on a short time scale of at most a few hundred milliseconds."
"Fast Classification Rates for High-dimensional Gaussian Generative Models. We consider the problem of binary classification when the covariates conditioned on the each of the response values follow multivariate Gaussian distributions. We focus on the setting where the covariance matrices for the two conditional distributions are the same. The corresponding generative model classifier, derived via the Bayes rule, also called Linear Discriminant Analysis, has been shown to behave poorly in high-dimensional settings. We present a novel analysis of the classification error of any linear discriminant approach given conditional Gaussian models. This allows us to compare the generative model classifier, other recently proposed discriminative approaches that directly learn the discriminant function, and then finally logistic regression which is another classical discriminative model classifier. As we show, under a natural sparsity assumption, and letting $s$ denote the sparsity of the Bayes classifier, $p$ the number of covariates, and $n$ the number of samples, the simple ($\ell_1$-regularized) logistic regression classifier achieves the fast misclassification error rates of $O\left(\frac{s \log p}{n}\right)$, which is much better than the other approaches, which are either inconsistent under high-dimensional settings, or achieve a slower rate of $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{s \log p}{n}}\right)$."
"Fast Distributed k-Center Clustering with Outliers on Massive Data. Clustering large data is a fundamental problem with a vast number of applications.  Due to the increasing size of data, practitioners interested in clustering have turned to distributed computation methods.  In this work, we consider the widely used k-center clustering problem and its variant used to handle noisy data, k-center with outliers. In the noise-free setting we demonstrate how a previously-proposed distributed method is actually an O(1)-approximation algorithm, which accurately explains its strong empirical performance. Additionally, in the noisy setting, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that is also an O(1)-approximation. These algorithms are highly parallel and lend themselves to virtually any distributed computing framework. We compare both empirically against the best known noisy sequential clustering methods and show that both distributed algorithms are consistently close to their sequential versions. The algorithms are all one can hope for in distributed settings: they are fast, memory efficient and they match their sequential counterparts."
"Human Memory Search as Initial-Visit Emitting Random Walk. Imagine a random walk that outputs a state only when visiting it for the first time. The observed output is therefore a repeat-censored version of the underlying walk, and consists of a permutation of the states or a prefix of it. We call this model initial-visit emitting random walk (INVITE). Prior work has shown that the random walks with such a repeat-censoring mechanism explain well human behavior in memory search tasks, which is of great interest in both the study of human cognition and various clinical applications. However, parameter estimation in INVITE is challenging, because naive likelihood computation by marginalizing over infinitely many hidden random walk trajectories is intractable. In this paper, we propose the first efficient maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for INVITE by decomposing the censored output into a series of absorbing random walks. We also prove theoretical properties of the MLE including identifiability and consistency. We show that INVITE outperforms several existing methods on real-world human response data from memory search tasks."
"Non-convex Statistical Optimization for Sparse Tensor Graphical Model. We consider the estimation of sparse graphical models that characterize the dependency structure of high-dimensional tensor-valued data. To facilitate the estimation of the precision matrix corresponding to each way of the tensor, we assume the data follow a tensor normal distribution whose covariance has a Kronecker product structure. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this model involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. In spite of the non-convexity of this estimation problem, we prove that an alternating minimization algorithm, which iteratively estimates each sparse precision matrix while fixing the others, attains an estimator with the optimal statistical rate of convergence as well as consistent graph recovery. Notably, such an estimator achieves estimation consistency with only one tensor sample, which is unobserved in previous work. Our theoretical results are backed by thorough numerical studies."
"Convergence Rates of Active Learning for Maximum Likelihood Estimation. An active learner is given a class of models, a large set of unlabeled examples, and the ability to interactively query labels of a subset of these examples; the goal of the learner is to learn a model in the class that fits the data well. Previous theoretical work has rigorously characterized label complexity of active learning, but most of this work has focused on the PAC or the agnostic PAC model. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting -- maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields. We provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extraround of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum likelihood estimation.  On the empirical side, the recent work in (Gu et al. 2012) and (Gu et al. 2014) (on active linear and logistic regression) shows the promise of this approach."
"Weakly-supervised Disentangling with Recurrent Transformations for 3D View Synthesis. An important problem for both graphics and vision is to synthesize novel views of a 3D object from a single image. This is in particular challenging due to the partial observability inherent in projecting a 3D object onto the image space, and the ill-posedness of inferring object shape and pose. However, we can train a neural network to address the problem if we restrict our attention to specific object classes (in our case faces and chairs) for which we can gather ample training data. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent convolutional encoder-decoder network that is trained end-to-end on the task of rendering rotated objects starting from a single image. The recurrent structure allows our model to capture long- term dependencies along a sequence of transformations, and we demonstrate the quality of its predictions for human faces on the Multi-PIE dataset and for a dataset of 3D chair models, and also show its ability of disentangling latent data factors without using object class labels."
"Efficient Exact Gradient Update for training Deep Networks with Very Large Sparse Targets. An important class of problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200,000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500) incurs a prohibitive $O(Dd)$ computational cost for each example, as does updating the $D \times d$ output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, this case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach that, for a family of loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in $O(d^2)$  per example instead of $O(Dd)$, remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of $\frac{D}{4d}$, i.e. two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture."
"Backpropagation for Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computing. Solving real world problems with embedded neural networks requires both training algorithms that achieve high performance and compatible hardware that runs in real time while remaining energy efficient. For the former, deep learning using backpropagation has recently achieved a string of successes across many domains and datasets.  For the latter, neuromorphic chips that run spiking neural networks have recently achieved unprecedented energy efficiency. To bring these two advances together, we must first resolve the incompatibility between backpropagation, which uses continuous-output neurons and synaptic weights, and neuromorphic designs, which employ spiking neurons and discrete synapses.  Our approach is to treat spikes and discrete synapses as continuous probabilities, which allows training the network using standard backpropagation. The trained network naturally maps to neuromorphic hardware by sampling the probabilities to create one or more networks, which are merged using ensemble averaging. To demonstrate, we trained a sparsely connected network that runs on the TrueNorth chip using the MNIST dataset. With a high performance network (ensemble of $64$), we achieve $99.42\%$ accuracy at $121 \mu$J per image, and with a high efficiency network (ensemble of $1$) we achieve $92.7\%$ accuracy at $0.408 \mu$J per image."
"Alternating Minimization for Regression Problems with Vector-valued Outputs. In regression problems involving vector-valued outputs (or equivalently, multiple responses), it is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which takes noise covariance structure into account, can be significantly more accurate than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. However, existing  literature compares OLS and MLE in terms of their asymptotic, not finite sample, guarantees. More crucially, computing the MLE in general requires solving a non-convex optimization problem and is not known to be efficiently solvable. We provide finite sample upper and lower bounds on the estimation error of OLS and MLE, in two popular models: a) Pooled model, b) Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model. We provide precise instances where the MLE is significantly more accurate than OLS. Furthermore, for both models, we show that the output of a computationally efficient alternating minimization procedure enjoys the same performance guarantee as MLE, up to universal constants. Finally, we show that for high-dimensional settings as well, the alternating minimization procedure leads to significantly more accurate solutions than the corresponding OLS solutions but with error bound that depends only logarithmically on the data dimensionality."
"Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Network. Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems. Also, conventional networks fix the architecture before training starts; as a result, training cannot improve the architecture. To address these limitations, we describe a method to reduce the storage and computation required by neural networks by an order of magnitude without affecting their accuracy by learning only the important connections. Our method prunes redundant connections using a three-step method. First, we train the network to learn which connections are important. Next, we prune the unimportant connections. Finally, we retrain the network to fine tune the weights of the remaining connections. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the number of parameters of AlexNet by a factor of 9×, from 61 million to 6.7 million, without incurring accuracy loss. Similar experiments with VGG-16 found that the total number of parameters can be reduced by 13×, from 138 million to 10.3 million, again with no loss of accuracy."
"Optimal Rates for Random Fourier Features. Kernel methods represent one of the most powerful tools in machine learning to tackle problems expressed in terms of function values and derivatives due to their capability to represent and model complex relations. While these methods show good versatility, they are computationally intensive and have poor scalability to large data as they require operations on Gram matrices. In order to mitigate this serious computational limitation, recently randomized constructions have been proposed in the literature, which allow the application of fast linear algorithms. Random Fourier features (RFF) are among the most popular and widely applied constructions: they provide an easily computable, low-dimensional feature representation for shift-invariant kernels. Despite the popularity of RFFs, very little is understood theoretically about their approximation quality. In this paper, we provide a detailed finite-sample theoretical analysis about the approximation quality of RFFs by (i) establishing optimal (in terms of the RFF dimension, and growing set size) performance guarantees in uniform norm, and (ii) presenting guarantees in L^r (1 ≤ r < ∞) norms. We also propose an RFF approximation to derivatives of a kernel with a theoretical study on its approximation quality."
"The Population Posterior and Bayesian Modeling on Streams. Many modern data analysis problems involve inferences from streaming data. However, streaming data is not easily amenable to the standard probabilistic modeling approaches, which assume that we condition on finite data. We develop population variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to analyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the population posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of the data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model.  We study our method with latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several large-scale data sets."
"Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature: Probabilistic Integration with Theoretical Guarantees. There is renewed interest in formulating integration as an inference problem, motivated by obtaining a full distribution over numerical error that can be propagated through subsequent computation. Current methods, such as Bayesian Quadrature, demonstrate impressive empirical performance but lack theoretical analysis. An important challenge is to reconcile these probabilistic integrators with rigorous convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present the first probabilistic integrator that admits such theoretical treatment, called Frank-Wolfe Bayesian Quadrature (FWBQ). Under FWBQ, convergence to the true value of the integral is shown to be exponential and posterior contraction rates are proven to be superexponential. In simulations, FWBQ is competitive with state-of-the-art methods and out-performs alternatives based on Frank-Wolfe optimisation. Our approach is applied to successfully quantify numerical error in the solution to a challenging model choice problem in cellular biology."
"Scheduled Sampling for Sequence Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks. Recurrent Neural Networks can be trained to produce sequences of tokens given some input, as exemplified by recent results in machine translation and image captioning. The current approach to training them consists of maximizing the likelihood of each token in the sequence given the current (recurrent) state and the previous token. At inference, the unknown previous token is then replaced by a token generated by the model itself. This discrepancy between training and inference can yield errors that can accumulate quickly along the generated sequence.  We propose a curriculum learning strategy to gently change the training process from a fully guided scheme using the true previous token, towards a less guided scheme which mostly uses the generated token instead.  Experiments on several sequence prediction tasks show that this approach yields significant improvements. Moreover, it was used successfully in our winning bid to the MSCOCO image captioning challenge, 2015."
"Unified View of Matrix Completion under General Structural Constraints. Matrix completion problems have been widely studied under special low dimensional structures such as low rank or structure induced by decomposable norms. In this paper, we present a unified analysis of matrix completion under general low-dimensional structural constraints induced by {\em any} norm regularization.We consider two estimators for the general problem of structured matrix completion, and provide unified upper bounds on the sample complexity and the estimation error. Our analysis relies on generic chaining, and we establish two intermediate results of independent interest: (a) in characterizing the size or complexity of low dimensional subsets in high dimensional ambient space, a certain \textit{\modified}~complexity measure encountered in the analysis of matrix completion problems is characterized in terms of a well understood complexity measure of Gaussian widths, and (b) it is shown that a form of restricted strong convexity holds for matrix completion problems under general norm regularization. Further, we provide several non-trivial examples of structures included in our framework, notably including the recently proposed spectral $k$-support norm."
"Efficient Output Kernel Learning for Multiple Tasks. The paradigm of multi-task learning is that one can achieve better generalization by learning tasks jointly and thus exploiting the similarity between the tasks rather than learning them independently of each other. While previously the relationship between tasks had to be user-defined in the form of an output kernel, recent  approaches jointly learn the tasks and the output kernel. As the output kernel is a positive semidefinite matrix, the resulting optimization problems are not scalable in the  number of tasks as an eigendecomposition is required in each step. Using the theory of positive semidefinite kernels we show in this paper that for a certain class of regularizers on the output kernel, the constraint of being positive semidefinite can be dropped as it is automatically satisfied for the relaxed problem. This leads to an unconstrained dual problem which can be solved efficiently. Experiments on several multi-task and multi-class data sets illustrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational efficiency as well as generalization performance."
"Scalable Adaptation of State Complexity for Nonparametric Hidden Markov Models. Bayesian nonparametric hidden Markov models are typically learned via fixed truncations of the infinite state space or local Monte Carlo proposals that make small changes to the state space. We develop an inference algorithm for the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model that scales to big datasets by processing a few sequences at a time yet allows rapid adaptation of the state space cardinality. Unlike previous point-estimate methods, our novel variational bound penalizes redundant or irrelevant states and thus enables optimization of the state space. Our birth proposals use observed data statistics to create useful new states that escape local optima. Merge and delete proposals remove ineffective states to yield simpler models with more affordable future computations. Experiments on speaker diarization, motion capture, and epigenetic chromatin datasets discover models that are more compact, more interpretable, and better aligned to ground truth segmentations than competitors. We have released an open-source Python implementation which can parallelize local inference steps across sequences."
"Variational Consensus Monte Carlo. Practitioners of Bayesian statistics have long depended on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain samples from intractable posterior distributions. Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the large datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed consensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel (Scott et al, 2013). A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding approximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The resulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a relaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise concave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior quality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured against serial MCMC) of up to 39% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations; similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92% on the task of estimating cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8 components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost compared to the runtime of serial MCMC, achieving near-ideal speedup in some instances."
"Newton-Stein Method: A Second Order Method for GLMs via Stein's Lemma. We consider the problem of efficiently computing the maximum likelihood estimator in Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)when the number of observations is much larger than the number of coefficients (n > > p > > 1). In this regime, optimization algorithms can immensely benefit fromapproximate second order information.We propose an alternative way of constructing the curvature information by formulatingit as an estimation problem and applying a Stein-type lemma, which allows further improvements through sub-sampling andeigenvalue thresholding.Our algorithm enjoys fast convergence rates, resembling that of second order methods, with modest per-iteration cost. We provide its convergence analysis for the case where the rows of the design matrix are i.i.d. samples with bounded support.We show that the convergence has two phases, aquadratic phase followed by a linear phase. Finally,we empirically demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the highest performancecompared to various algorithms on several datasets."
"Practical and Optimal LSH for Angular Distance. We show the existence of a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) family for the angular distance that yields an approximate Near Neighbor Search algorithm with the asymptotically optimal  running time exponent. Unlike earlier algorithms with this property (e.g., Spherical LSH (Andoni-Indyk-Nguyen-Razenshteyn 2014) (Andoni-Razenshteyn 2015)), our algorithm is also practical, improving upon the well-studied hyperplane LSH (Charikar 2002) in practice. We also introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm and conduct an experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data sets.We complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for the quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies that the above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and quality that is close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions."
"Learning to Linearize Under Uncertainty. Training deep feature hierarchies to solve supervised learning tasks has achieving state of the art performance on many problems in computer vision. However, a principled way in which to train such hierarchies in the unsupervised setting has remained elusive. In this work we suggest a new architecture and loss for training deep feature hierarchies that linearize the transformations observed in unlabelednatural video sequences. This is done by training a generative model to predict video frames. We also address the problem of inherent uncertainty in prediction by introducing a latent variables that are non-deterministic functions of the input into the network architecture."
"Finite-Time Analysis of Projected Langevin Monte Carlo. We analyze the projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, a close cousin of projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We show that LMC allows to sample in polynomial time from a posterior distribution restricted to a convex body and with concave log-likelihood. This gives the first Markov chain to sample from a log-concave distribution with a first-order oracle, as the existing chains with provable guarantees (lattice walk, ball walk and hit-and-run) require a zeroth-order oracle. Our proof uses elementary concepts from stochastic calculus which could be useful more generally to understand SGD and its variants."
"Deep Visual Analogy-Making. In addition to identifying the content within a single image, relating images and generating related images are critical tasks for image understanding. Recently, deep convolutional networks have yielded breakthroughs in producing image labels, annotations and captions, but have only just begun to be used for producing high-quality image outputs. In this paper we develop a novel deep network trained end-to-end to perform visual analogy making, which is the task of transforming a query image according to an example pair of related images. Solving this problem requires both accurately recognizing a visual relationship and generating a transformed query image accordingly. Inspired by recent advances in language modeling, we propose to solve visual analogies by learning to map images to a neural embedding in which analogical reasoning is simple, such as by vector subtraction and addition. In experiments, our model effectively models visual analogies on several datasets: 2D shapes, animated video game sprites, and 3D car models."
"Matrix Completion from Fewer Entries: Spectral Detectability and Rank Estimation. The completion of low rank matrices from few entries is a task with many practical applications. We consider here two aspects of this problem: detectability, i.e. the ability to estimate the rank $r$ reliably from the fewest possible random entries, and performance in achieving small reconstruction error. We propose a spectral algorithm for these two tasks called MaCBetH (for Matrix Completion with the Bethe Hessian). The rank is estimated as the number of negative eigenvalues of the Bethe Hessian matrix, and the corresponding eigenvectors are used as initial condition for the minimization of the discrepancy between the estimated matrix and the revealed entries.  We analyze the performance in a random matrix setting using results from the statistical mechanics of the Hopfield neural network, and show in particular that MaCBetH efficiently detects the rank $r$ of a large $n\times m$ matrix from $C(r)r\sqrt{nm}$ entries, where $C(r)$ is a constant close to $1$.  We also evaluate the corresponding root-mean-square error empirically and show that MaCBetH compares favorably to other existing approaches."
"Online Learning with Adversarial Delays. We study the performance of standard online learning algorithms when the feedback is delayed by an adversary. We show that \texttt{online-gradient-descent} and \texttt{follow-the-perturbed-leader} achieve regret $O(\sqrt{D})$ in the delayed setting, where $D$ is the sum of delays of each round's feedback. This bound collapses to an optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound in the usual setting of no delays (where $D = T$).  Our main contribution is to show that standard algorithms for online learning already have simple regret bounds in the most general setting of delayed feedback, making adjustments to the analysis and not to the algorithms themselves.  Our results help affirm and clarify the success of recent algorithms in optimization and machine learning that operate in a delayed feedback model."
"Multi-Layer Feature Reduction for Tree Structured Group Lasso via Hierarchical Projection. Tree structured group Lasso (TGL) is a powerful technique in uncovering the tree structured sparsity over the features, where each node encodes a group of features. It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. However, with extremely large feature dimensions, solving TGL remains a significant challenge due to its highly complicated regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response. Thus, we can remove the detected nodes from the optimization without sacrificing accuracy. The major challenge in developing such testing rules is due to the overlaps between the parents and their children nodes. By a novel hierarchical projection algorithm, MLFre is able to test the nodes independently from any of their ancestor nodes. Moreover, we can integrate MLFre---that has a low computational cost---with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the speedup gained by MLFre can be orders of magnitude."
"Minimum Weight Perfect Matching via Blossom Belief Propagation. Max-product Belief Propagation (BP) is a popular message-passing algorithm for computing a Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) assignment over a distribution represented by a Graphical Model (GM). It has been shown that BP can solve a number of combinatorial optimization problems including minimum weight matching, shortest path, network flow and vertex cover under the following common assumption: the respective Linear Programming (LP) relaxation is tight, i.e.,  no integrality gap is present.  However, when LP shows an integrality gap, no model has been known which can be solved systematically via sequential applications of BP. In this paper, we develop the first such algorithm, coined Blossom-BP, for solving the minimum weight matching problem over arbitrary graphs. Each step of the sequential algorithm requires applying BP over a modified graph constructed by contractions and expansions of blossoms, i.e., odd sets of vertices. Our scheme guarantees termination in O(n^2) of BP runs, where n is the number of vertices in the original graph. In essence, the Blossom-BP offers a distributed version of the celebrated Edmonds' Blossom algorithm by jumping at once over many sub-steps with a single BP. Moreover, our result provides an interpretation of the Edmonds' algorithm as a sequence of LPs."
"Efficient Thompson Sampling for Online ￼Matrix-Factorization Recommendation. Matrix factorization (MF) collaborative filtering is an effective and widely used method in recommendation systems. However, the problem of finding an optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation (otherwise known as the bandit problem), a crucial problem in collaborative filtering from cold-start, has not been previously addressed.In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for online MF recommendation that automatically combines finding the most relevantitems with exploring new or less-recommended items.Our approach, called Particle Thompson Sampling for Matrix-Factorization, is based on the general Thompson sampling framework, but augmented with a novel efficient online Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization method based on the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter.Extensive experiments in collaborative filtering using several real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts."
"Improved Iteration Complexity Bounds of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent for Convex Problems. The iteration complexity of the block-coordinate descent (BCD) type algorithm has been under extensive investigation. It was recently shown that for convex problems the classical cyclic BCGD (block coordinate gradient descent) achieves an O(1/r) complexity (r is the number of passes of all blocks). However, such bounds are at least linearly depend on $K$ (the number of variable blocks), and are at least $K$ times worse than those of the gradient descent (GD) and proximal gradient (PG) methods.In this paper, we close such theoretical performance gap between cyclic BCD and GD/PG. First we show that for a family of quadratic nonsmooth problems, the complexity bounds for cyclic Block Coordinate Proximal Gradient (BCPG), a popular variant of BCD, can match those of the GD/PG in terms of dependency on $K$ (up to a \log^2(K) factor). Second, we establish an improved complexity bound for Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for general convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our bounds are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least $K$ times worse than GD. {Our analyses do not depend on the update order of block variables inside each cycle, thus our results also apply to BCD methods with random permutation (random sampling without replacement, another popular variant)."
"Lifted Symmetry Detection and Breaking for MAP Inference. Symmetry breaking is a technique for speeding up propositional satisfiability testing by adding constraints to the theory that restrict the search space while preserving satisfiability. In this work, we extend symmetry breaking to the problem of model finding in weighted and unweighted relational theories, a class of problems that includes MAP inference in Markov Logic and similar statistical-relational languages. We introduce term symmetries, which are induced by an evidence set and extend to symmetries over a relational theory. We provide the important special case of term equivalent symmetries, showing that such symmetries can be found in low-degree polynomial time. We show how to break an exponential number of these symmetries with added constraints whose number is linear in the size of the domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through experiments in two relational domains. We also discuss the connections between relational symmetry breaking and work on lifted inference in statistical-relational reasoning."
"Evaluating the statistical significance of biclusters. Biclustering (also known as submatrix localization) is a problem of high practical relevance in exploratory analysis of high-dimensional data. We develop a framework for performing statistical inference on biclusters found by score-based algorithms. Since the bicluster was selected in a data dependent manner by a biclustering or localization algorithm, this is a form of selective inference. Our framework gives exact (non-asymptotic) confidence intervals and p-values for the significance of the selected biclusters. Further, we generalize our approach to obtain exact inference for Gaussian statistics."
"Discriminative Robust Transformation Learning. This paper proposes a framework for learning features that are robust to data variation, which is particularly important when only a limited number of trainingsamples are available. The framework makes it possible to tradeoff the discriminative value of learned features against the generalization error of the learning algorithm. Robustness is achieved by encouraging the transform that maps data to features to be a local isometry. This geometric property is shown to improve (K, \epsilon)-robustness, thereby providing theoretical justification for reductions in generalization error observed in experiments. The proposed optimization frameworkis used to train standard learning algorithms such as deep neural networks. Experimental results obtained on benchmark datasets, such as labeled faces in the wild,demonstrate the value of being able to balance discrimination and robustness."
"Bandits with Unobserved Confounders: A Causal Approach. The Multi-Armed Bandit problem constitutes an archetypal setting for sequential decision-making, permeating multiple domains including engineering, business, and medicine. One of the hallmarks of a bandit setting is the agent's capacity to explore its environment through active intervention, which contrasts with the ability to collect passive data by estimating associational relationships between actions and payouts. The existence of unobserved confounders, namely unmeasured variables affecting both the action and the outcome variables, implies that these two data-collection modes will in general not coincide. In this paper, we show that formalizing this distinction has conceptual and algorithmic implications to the bandit setting. The current generation of bandit algorithms implicitly try to maximize rewards based on estimation of the experimental distribution, which we show is not always the best strategy to pursue. Indeed, to achieve low regret in certain realistic classes of bandit problems (namely, in the face of unobserved confounders), both experimental and observational quantities are required by the rational agent. After this realization, we propose an optimization metric (employing both experimental and observational distributions) that bandit agents should pursue, and illustrate its benefits over traditional algorithms."
"Scalable Semi-Supervised Aggregation of Classifiers. We present and empirically evaluate an efficient algorithm that learns to aggregate the predictions of an ensemble of binary classifiers. The algorithm uses the structure of the ensemble predictions on unlabeled data to yield significant performance improvements. It does this without making assumptions on the structure or origin of the ensemble, without parameters, and as scalably as linear learning. We empirically demonstrate these performance gains with random forests."
"Online Learning with Gaussian Payoffs and Side Observations. We consider a sequential learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side information: after selecting an action $i$, the learner receives information about the payoff of every action $j$ in the form of Gaussian observations whose mean is the same as the mean payoff, but the variance depends on the pair $(i,j)$ (and may be infinite). The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm, which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finite-time minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to  logarithmic factors)."
"Private Graphon Estimation for Sparse Graphs. We design algorithms for fitting a high-dimensional statistical model to a large, sparse network without revealing sensitive information of individual members.  Given a sparse input graph $G$, our algorithms output a node-differentially private nonparametric block model approximation.  By node-differentially private, we mean that our output hides the insertion or removal of a vertex and all its adjacent edges.  If $G$ is an instance of the network obtained from a generative nonparametric model defined in terms of a graphon $W$, our model guarantees consistency: as the number of vertices tends to infinity, the output of our algorithm converges to $W$ in an appropriate version of the $L_2$ norm. In particular, this means we can estimate the sizes of all multi-way cuts in $G$.  Our results hold as long as $W$ is bounded, the average degree of $G$ grows at least like the log of the number of vertices, and the number of blocks goes to infinity at an appropriate rate.  We give explicit error bounds in terms of the parameters of the model; in several settings, our bounds improve on or match known nonprivate results."
"SubmodBoxes: Near-Optimal Search for a Set of Diverse Object Proposals. This paper formulates the search for a set of bounding boxes (as needed in object proposal generation) as a monotone submodular maximization problem over the space of all possible bounding boxes in an image. Since the number of possible bounding boxes in an image is very large $O(#pixels^2)$, even a single linear scan to perform the greedy augmentation for submodular maximization is intractable. Thus, we formulate the greedy augmentation step as a Branch-and-Bound scheme. In order to speed up repeated application of B\&B, we propose a novel generalization of Minoux’s ‘lazy greedy’ algorithm to the B\&B tree. Theoretically, our proposed formulation provides a new understanding to the problem, and contains classic heuristic approaches such as Sliding Window+Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) and and Efficient Subwindow Search (ESS) as special cases. Empirically, we show that our approach leads to a state-of-art performance on object proposal generation via a novel diversity measure."
"Fast Second Order Stochastic Backpropagation for Variational Inference. We propose a second-order (Hessian or Hessian-free) based optimization method for variational inference inspired by Gaussian backpropagation, and argue that quasi-Newton optimization can be developed as well.  This is accomplished by generalizing the gradient computation in stochastic backpropagation via a reparametrization trick with lower complexity. As an illustrative example, we apply this approach to the problems of Bayesian logistic regression and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Additionally, we compute bounds on the estimator variance of intractable expectations for the family  of Lipschitz continuous function. Our method is practical, scalable and model free. We demonstrate our method on several real-world datasets and provide comparisons with other stochastic gradient methods to show substantial enhancement in convergence rates."
"Randomized Block Krylov Methods for Stronger and Faster Approximate Singular Value Decomposition. Since being analyzed by Rokhlin, Szlam, and Tygert and popularized by Halko, Martinsson, and Tropp, randomized Simultaneous Power Iteration has become the method of choice for approximate singular value decomposition. It is more accurate than simpler sketching algorithms, yet still converges quickly for *any* matrix, independently of singular value gaps. After ~O(1/epsilon) iterations, it gives a low-rank approximation within (1+epsilon) of optimal for spectral norm error.We give the first provable runtime improvement on Simultaneous Iteration: a randomized block Krylov method, closely related to the classic Block Lanczos algorithm, gives the same guarantees in just ~O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) iterations and performs substantially better experimentally. Our analysis is the first of a Krylov subspace method that does not depend on singular value gaps, which are unreliable in practice.Furthermore, while it is a simple accuracy benchmark, even (1+epsilon) error for spectral norm low-rank approximation does not imply that an algorithm returns high quality principal components, a major issue for data applications. We address this problem for the first time by showing that both Block Krylov Iteration and Simultaneous Iteration give nearly optimal PCA for any matrix. This result further justifies their strength over non-iterative sketching methods."
"Cross-Domain Matching for Bag-of-Words Data via Kernel Embeddings of Latent Distributions. We propose a kernel-based method for finding matching between instances across different domains, such as multilingual documents and images with annotations. Each instance is assumed to be represented as a multiset of features, e.g., a bag-of-words representation for documents. The major difficulty in finding cross-domain relationships is that the similarity between instances in different domains cannot be directly measured. To overcome this difficulty, the proposed method embeds all the features of different domains in a shared latent space, and regards each instance as a distribution of its own features in the shared latent space. To represent the distributions efficiently and nonparametrically, we employ the framework of the kernel embeddings of distributions. The embedding is estimated so as to minimize the difference between distributions of paired instances while keeping unpaired instances apart. In our experiments, we show that the proposed method can achieve high performance on finding correspondence between multi-lingual Wikipedia articles, between documents and tags, and between images and tags."
"Scalable Inference for Gaussian Process Models with Black-Box Likelihoods. We propose a sparse method for scalable automated variational inference (AVI) in a large class of models with Gaussian process (GP) priors, multiple latent functions, multiple outputs and non-linear likelihoods. Our approach maintains the statistical efficiency property of the original AVI method, requiring only expectations over univariate Gaussian distributions to approximate the posterior with a mixture of Gaussians. Experiments on small datasets for various problems including  regression, classification, Log Gaussian Cox processes, and warped GPs show that our method can perform as well as the full method under high levels of sparsity. On larger experiments using the MNIST and the SARCOS datasets we show that our method can provide superior performance to previously published scalable approaches that have been handcrafted to specific likelihood models."
"Fast Bidirectional Probability Estimation in Markov Models. We develop a new bidirectional algorithm for estimating Markov chain multi-step transition probabilities: given a Markov chain, we want to estimate the probability of hitting a given target state in $\ell$ steps after starting from a given source distribution. Given the target state $t$, we use a (reverse) local power iteration to construct an `expanded target distribution', which has the same mean as the quantity we want to estimate, but a smaller variance -- this can then be sampled efficiently by a Monte Carlo algorithm. Our method extends to any Markov chain on a discrete (finite or countable) state-space, and can be extended to compute functions of multi-step transition probabilities such as PageRank, graph diffusions, hitting/return times, etc. Our main result is that in `sparse' Markov Chains -- wherein the number of transitions between states is  comparable to the number of states -- the running time of our algorithm for a uniform-random target node is order-wise smaller than Monte Carlo and power iteration based algorithms; in particular, our method can estimate a probability $p$ using only $O(1/\sqrt{p})$ running time."
"Probabilistic Variational Bounds for Graphical Models. Variational algorithms such as tree-reweighted belief propagation can provide deterministic bounds on the partition function, but are often loose and difficult to use in an ``any-time'' fashion, expending more computation for tighter bounds.  On the other hand, Monte Carlo estimators such as importance sampling have excellent any-time behavior, but depend critically on the proposal distribution. We propose a simple Monte Carlo based inference method that augments convex variational bounds by adding importance sampling (IS). We argue that convex variational methods naturally provide good IS proposals that ``cover the probability of the target distribution, and reinterpret the variational optimization as designing a proposal to minimizes an upper bound on the variance of our IS estimator. This both provides an accurate estimator and enables the construction of any-time probabilistic bounds that improve quickly and directly on state of-the-art variational bounds, which provide certificates of accuracy given enough samples relative to the error in the initial bound."
"Linear Response Methods for Accurate Covariance Estimates from Mean Field Variational Bayes. Mean field variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, a well known failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance. We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data."
"Combinatorial Cascading Bandits. We propose combinatorial cascading bandits, a class of partial monitoring problems where at each step a learning agent chooses a tuple of ground items subject to constraints and receives a reward if and only if the weights of all chosen items are one. The weights of the items are binary, stochastic, and drawn independently of each other. The agent observes the index of the first chosen item whose weight is zero. This observation model arises in network routing, for instance, where the learning agent may only observe the first link in the routing path which is down, and blocks the path. We propose a UCB-like algorithm for solving our problems, CombCascade; and prove gap-dependent and gap-free upper bounds on its n-step regret. Our proofs build on recent work in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits but also address two novel challenges of our setting, a non-linear reward function and partial observability. We evaluate CombCascade on two real-world problems and show that it performs well even when our modeling assumptions are violated. We also demonstrate that our setting requires a new learning algorithm."
"Mixing Time Estimation in Reversible Markov Chains from a Single Sample Path. This article provides the first procedure for computing a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time $t_{mix}$ of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at a prescribed confidence level.  The interval is computed from a single finite-length sample path from the Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any parameters of the chain.  This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior knowledge.  The interval is constructed around the relaxation time $t_{relax}$, which is strongly related to the mixing time, and the width of the interval converges to zero roughly at a $\sqrt{n}$ rate, where $n$ is the length of the sample path.  Upper and lower bounds are given on the number of samples required to achieve constant-factor multiplicative accuracy.  The lower bounds indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure can achieve this accuracy level before seeing each state at least $\Omega(t_{relax})$ times on the average.  Finally, future directions of research are identified."
"Policy Gradient for Coherent Risk Measures. Several authors have recently developed risk-sensitive policy gradient methods that augment the standard expected cost minimization problem with a measure of variability in cost. These studies have focused on specific risk-measures, such as the variance or conditional value at risk (CVaR). In this work, we extend the policy gradient method to the whole class of coherent risk measures, which is widely accepted in finance and operations research, among other fields. We consider both static and time-consistent dynamic risk measures. For static risk measures, our approach is in the spirit of policy gradient algorithms and combines a standard sampling approach with convex programming. For dynamic risk measures, our approach is actor-critic style and involves explicit approximation of value function. Most importantly, our contribution presents a unified approach to risk-sensitive reinforcement learning that generalizes and extends previous results."
"Fast Rates for Exp-concave Empirical Risk Minimization. We consider Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) in the context of stochastic optimization with exp-concave and smooth losses---a general optimization framework that captures several important learning problems including linear and logistic regression, learning SVMs with the squared hinge-loss, portfolio selection and more. In this setting, we establish the first evidence that ERM is able to attain fast generalization rates, and show that the expected loss of the ERM solution in $d$ dimensions converges to the optimal expected loss in a rate of $d/n$. This rate matches existing lower bounds up to constants and improves by a $\log{n}$ factor upon the state-of-the-art, which is only known to be attained by an online-to-batch conversion of computationally expensive online algorithms."
"Deep Generative Image Models using a ￼Laplacian Pyramid of Adversarial Networks. In this paper we introduce a generative model capable of producing high quality samples of natural images. Our approach uses a cascade of convolutional networks (convnets) within a Laplacian pyramid framework to generate images in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of the pyramid a separate generative convnet model is trained using the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) approach. Samples drawn from our model are of significantly higher quality than  existing models. In a quantitive assessment by human evaluators our CIFAR10 samples were mistaken for real images around 40%  of the time, compared to 10% for GAN samples. We also show samples from more diverse datasets such as STL10 and LSUN."
"Decoupled Deep Neural Network for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation. We propose a novel deep neural network architecture for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using heterogeneous annotations. Contrary to existing approaches posing semantic segmentation as region-based classification, our algorithm decouples classification and segmentation, and learns a separate network for each task. In this architecture, labels associated with an image are identified by classification network, and binary segmentation is subsequently performed for each identified label by segmentation network. The decoupled architecture enables us to learn classification and segmentation networks separately based on the training data with image-level and pixel-wise class labels, respectively. It facilitates to reduce search space for segmentation effectively by exploiting class-specific activation maps obtained from bridging layers. Our algorithm shows outstanding performance compared to other semi-supervised approaches even with much less training images with strong annotations in PASCAL VOC dataset."
"Equilibrated adaptive learning rates for non-convex optimization. Parameter-specific adaptive learning rate methods are computationally efficient ways to reduce the ill-conditioning problems encountered when training large deep networks. Following recent work that strongly suggests that most of thecritical points encountered when training such networks are saddle points, we find how considering the presence of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian could help us design better suited adaptive learning rate schemes. We show that the popular Jacobi preconditioner has undesirable behavior in the presence of both positive and negative curvature, and present theoretical and empirical evidence that the so-called equilibration preconditioner is comparatively better suited to non-convex problems. We introduce a novel adaptive learning rate scheme, called ESGD, based on the equilibration preconditioner. Our experiments demonstrate that both schemes yield very similar step directions but that ESGD sometimes surpasses RMSProp in terms of convergence speed, always clearly improving over plain stochastic gradient descent."
"BACKSHIFT: Learning causal cyclic graphs from unknown shift interventions. We propose a simple method to learn linear causal cyclic models in the presence of latent variables. The method relies on equilibrium data of the model recorded under a specific kind of interventions (``shift interventions''). The location and strength of these interventions do not have to be known and can be estimated from the data. Our method, called BACKSHIFT, only uses second moments of the data and performs simple joint matrix diagonalization, applied to differences between covariance matrices. We give a sufficient and necessary condition for identifiability of the system, which is fulfilled almost surely under some quite general assumptions if and only if there are at least three distinct experimental settings, one of which can be pure observational data. We demonstrate the performance on some simulated data and applications in flow cytometry and financial time series."
"Risk-Sensitive and Robust Decision-Making: a CVaR Optimization Approach. In this paper we address the problem of decision making within a Markov decision process (MDP) framework where risk and modeling errors are taken into account. Our approach is to  minimize a risk-sensitive conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) objective, as opposed to a standard risk-neutral expectation. We refer to such problem as CVaR MDP. Our first contribution is to show that a CVaR objective, besides capturing risk sensitivity, has an alternative interpretation as expected cost under worst-case modeling errors, for a given error budget. This result, which is of independent interest,  motivates CVaR MDPs as a unifying framework for risk-sensitive and robust decision making. Our second contribution is to present a value-iteration algorithm for CVaR MDPs, and analyze its convergence rate. To our knowledge, this is the first solution algorithm for CVaR MDPs that enjoys error guarantees. Finally, we present results from numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings and show the practicality of our approach."
"Asynchronous stochastic convex optimization: the noise is in the noise and SGD don't care. We show that asymptotically, completely asynchronous stochastic gradient procedures achieve optimal (even to constant factors) convergence rates for the solution of convex optimization problems under nearly the same conditions required for asymptotic optimality of standard stochastic gradient procedures. Roughly, the noise inherent to the stochastic approximation scheme dominates any noise from asynchrony. We also give empirical evidence demonstrating the strong performance of asynchronous, parallel stochastic optimization schemes, demonstrating that the robustness inherent to stochastic approximation problems allows substantially faster parallel and asynchronous solution methods. In short, we show that for many stochastic approximation problems, as Freddie Mercury sings in Queen's \emph{Bohemian Rhapsody}, ``Nothing really matters.''"
"Lifelong Learning with Non-i.i.d. Tasks. In this work we aim at extending theoretical foundations of lifelong learning. Previous work analyzing this scenario is based on the assumption that the tasks are sampled i.i.d. from a task environment or limited to strongly constrained data distributions. Instead we study two scenarios when lifelong learning is possible, even though the observed tasks do not form an i.i.d. sample: first, when they are sampled from the same environment, but possibly with dependencies, and second, when the task environment is allowed to change over time. In the first case we prove a PAC-Bayesian theorem, which can be seen as a direct generalization of the analogous previous result for the i.i.d. case. For the second scenario we propose to learn an inductive bias in form of a transfer procedure. We present a generalization bound and show on a toy example how it can be used to identify a beneficial transfer algorithm."
"Optimal Linear Estimation under Unknown Nonlinear Transform. Linear regression studies the problem of estimating a model parameter $\beta^* \in \R^p$, from $n$ observations $\{(y_i,x_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ from linear model $y_i = \langle \x_i,\beta^* \rangle + \epsilon_i$. We consider a significant generalization in which the relationship between $\langle x_i,\beta^* \rangle$ and $y_i$ is noisy, quantized to a single bit, potentially nonlinear, noninvertible, as well as unknown. This model is known as the single-index model in statistics, and, among other things, it represents a significant generalization of one-bit compressed sensing. We propose a novel spectral-based estimation procedure and show that we can recover $\beta^*$ in settings (i.e., classes of link function $f$) where previous algorithms fail. In general, our algorithm requires only very mild restrictions on the (unknown) functional relationship between $y_i$ and $\langle x_i,\beta^* \rangle$. We also consider the high dimensional setting where $\beta^*$ is sparse, and introduce a two-stage nonconvex framework that addresses estimation challenges in high dimensional regimes where $p \gg n$. For a broad class of link functions between $\langle x_i,\beta^* \rangle$ and $y_i$, we establish minimax lower bounds that demonstrate the optimality of our estimators in both the classical and high dimensional regimes."
"Learning with Group Invariant Features: A Kernel Perspective.. We analyze in this paper a random feature map based on a  theory of invariance (\emph{I-theory}) introduced in \cite{AnselmiLRMTP13}. More specifically, a group invariant  signal signature is obtained through cumulative distributions of group-transformed random projections. Our analysis bridges invariant feature learning with kernel methods, as we show that this feature map defines an expected Haar-integration kernel that is invariant to the specified group action. We show how this non-linear random feature map approximates this group invariant kernel uniformly on a  set of $N$ points. Moreover, we show that it defines a function space that is dense in the equivalent Invariant Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Finally, we quantify error rates of the convergence of the empirical risk minimization, as well as the reduction in the sample complexity of a learning algorithm using such an invariant representation for signal classification, in a classical supervised learning setting"
"Regularized EM Algorithms: A Unified Framework and Statistical Guarantees. Latent models are a fundamental modeling tool in machine learning applications, but they present significant computational and analytical challenges. The popular EM algorithm and its variants, is a much used algorithmic tool; yet our rigorous understanding of its performance is highly incomplete. Recently, work in [1] has demonstrated that for an important class of problems, EM exhibits linear local convergence. In the high-dimensional setting, however, the M-step may not be well defined. We address precisely this setting through a unified treatment using regularization. While regularization for high-dimensional problems is by now well understood, the iterative EM algorithm requires a careful balancing of making progress towards the solution while identifying the right structure (e.g., sparsity or low-rank). In particular, regularizing the M-step using the state-of-the-art high-dimensional prescriptions (e.g., \`a la [19]) is not guaranteed to provide this balance. Our algorithm and analysis are linked in a way that reveals the balance between optimization and statistical errors. We specialize our general framework to sparse gaussian mixture models, high-dimensional mixed regression, and regression with missing variables, obtaining statistical guarantees for each of these examples."
"Adaptive Stochastic Optimization: From Sets to Paths. Adaptive stochastic optimization optimizes an objective function adaptively under uncertainty. Adaptive stochastic optimization plays a crucial role in planning and learning under uncertainty, but is, unfortunately, computationally intractable in general.  This paper introduces two conditions on the objective function, the marginal likelihood rate bound and the marginal likelihood bound, which enable efficient approximate solution of adaptive stochastic optimization. Several interesting classes of functions satisfy these conditions naturally, e.g., the version space reduction function for hypothesis learning.  We describe Recursive Adaptive Coverage (RAC),  a new adaptive stochastic optimization algorithm that exploits these conditions, and apply it to two planning tasks under uncertainty. In constrast to the earlier submodular optimization approach, our algorithm applies to adaptive stochastic optimization algorithm over both sets and paths."
"Beyond Convexity: Stochastic Quasi-Convex Optimization. This poster has been moved from Monday #86 to Thursday #101.

Stochastic convex optimization is a basic and well studied primitive in machine learning. It is well known that convex and Lipschitz functions can be minimized efficiently using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).The Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) algorithm, is an adaptation of Gradient Descent, which updates according to the direction of the gradients, rather than the gradients themselves. In this paper we analyze a stochastic version of NGD and prove its convergence to a global minimum for a wider class of functions: we require the functions to be quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz. Quasi-convexity broadens the concept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain types of saddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be Lipschitz in a small region around the optimum. This assumption circumvents gradient explosion, which is another known hurdle for gradient descent variants. Interestingly, unlike the vanilla SGD algorithm, the stochastic normalized gradient descent algorithm provably requires a minimal minibatch size."
"A Tractable Approximation to Optimal Point Process Filtering: Application to Neural Encoding. The process of dynamic state estimation (filtering) based on point process observations is in general intractable. Numerical sampling techniques are often practically useful, but lead to limited conceptual insight about optimal encoding/decoding strategies, which are of significant relevance to Computational Neuroscience. We develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering based on point process observations, which allows us to introduce distributional assumptions about sensory cell properties, that greatly facilitates the analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of uniform coding. The analytic framework leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical algorithms, and is consistent with experiments about the distribution of tuning curve centers. Interestingly, we find that the information gained from the absence of spikes may be crucial to performance."
"Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds for Sparse PCA. This paper establishes a statistical versus computational trade-offfor solving a basic high-dimensional machine learning problem via a basic convex relaxation method. Specifically, we consider the {\em Sparse Principal Component Analysis} (Sparse PCA) problem, and the family of {\em Sum-of-Squares} (SoS, aka Lasserre/Parillo) convex relaxations. It was well known that in large dimension $p$, a planted $k$-sparse unit vector can be {\em in principle} detected using only $n \approx k\log p$ (Gaussian or Bernoulli) samples, but all {\em efficient} (polynomial time) algorithms known require $n \approx k^2 $ samples. It was also known that this quadratic gap cannot be improved by the the most basic {\em semi-definite} (SDP, aka spectral) relaxation, equivalent to a degree-2 SoS algorithms. Here we prove that also degree-4 SoS algorithms cannot improve this quadratic gap. This average-case lower bound adds to the small collection of hardness results in machine learning for this powerful family of convex relaxation algorithms. Moreover, our design of moments (or ``pseudo-expectations'') for this lower bound is quite different than previous lower bounds. Establishing lower bounds for higher degree SoS algorithms for remains a challenging problem."
"Max-Margin Majority Voting for Learning from Crowds. Learning-from-crowds aims to design proper aggregation strategies to infer the unknown true labels from the noisy labels provided by ordinary web workers. This paper presents max-margin majority voting (M^3V) to improve the discriminative ability of majority voting and further presents a Bayesian generalization to incorporate the flexibility of generative methods on modeling noisy observations with worker confusion matrices. We formulate the joint learning as a regularized Bayesian inference problem, where the posterior regularization is derived by maximizing the margin between the aggregated score of a potential true label and that of any alternative label. Our Bayesian model naturally covers the Dawid-Skene estimator and M^3V. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods are competitive, often achieving better results than state-of-the-art estimators."
"Learning with Incremental Iterative Regularization. Within a statistical learning setting,  we propose and study an iterative regularization algorithm for least squares defined by  an incremental gradient method.   In particular, we show that, if all other parameters are fixed a priori, the number of passes over the data (epochs) acts as a regularization parameter, and  prove strong universal consistency, i.e.  almost sure convergence of the risk, as well as  sharp finite sample bounds for the iterates. Our  results are a step towards understanding the effect of multiple epochs in  stochastic gradient techniques in machine learning and rely  on  integrating  statistical and optimizationresults."
"Halting in Random Walk Kernels. Random walk kernels measure graph similarity by counting matching walks in two graphs. In their most popular form of geometric random walk kernels, longer walks of length $k$ are downweighted by a factor of $\lambda^k$ ($\lambda < 1$) to ensure convergence of the corresponding geometric series. We know from the field of link prediction that this downweighting often leads to a phenomenon referred to as halting: Longer walks are downweighted so much that the similarity score is completely dominated by the comparison of walks of length 1. This is a naive kernel between edges and vertices. We theoretically show that halting may occur in geometric random walk kernels. We also empirically quantify its impact in simulated datasets and popular graph classification benchmark datasets. Our findings promise to be instrumental in future graph kernel development and applications of random walk kernels."
"MCMC for Variationally Sparse Gaussian Processes. Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large; how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is sparse in sup- port of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs."
"Less is More: Nyström Computational Regularization. We study Nyström type subsampling approaches  to large   scale  kernel methods, and  prove   learning bounds in the  statistical learning setting,  where random sampling and high probability estimates are considered.   In particular, we prove that these approaches  can achieve optimal learning bounds, provided the subsampling level is suitably chosen. These results suggest a simple  incremental variant of Nyström kernel ridge regression, where the subsampling level  controls at the same time  regularization and computations.  Extensive experimental analysis shows that the considered approach achieves state of the art performances on benchmark large scale datasets."
"Infinite Factorial Dynamical Model. We propose the infinite factorial dynamic model (iFDM), a general Bayesian nonparametric model for source separation. Our model builds on the Markov Indian buffet process to consider a potentially unbounded number of hidden Markov chains (sources) that evolve independently according to some dynamics, in which the state space can be either discrete or continuous. For posterior inference, we develop an algorithm based on particle Gibbs with ancestor sampling that can be efficiently applied to a wide range of source separation problems. We evaluate the performance of our iFDM on four well-known applications: multitarget tracking, cocktail party,  power disaggregation, and multiuser detection. Our experimental results show that our approach for source separation does not only outperform previous approaches, but it can also handle problems that were computationally intractable for existing approaches."
"Regularization Path of Cross-Validation Error Lower Bounds. Careful tuning of a regularization parameter is indispensable in many machine learning tasks because it has a significant impact on generalization performances.Nevertheless, current practice of regularization parameter tuning is more of an art than a science, e.g., it is hard to tell how many grid-points would be needed in cross-validation (CV) for obtaining a solution with sufficiently small CV error.In this paper we propose a novel framework for computing a lower bound of the CV errors as a function of the regularization parameter, which we call regularization path of CV error lower bounds.The proposed framework can be used for providing a theoretical approximation guarantee on a set of solutions in the sense that how far the CV error of the current best solution could be away from best possible CV error in the entire range of the regularization parameters.We demonstrate through numerical experiments that a theoretically guaranteed a choice of regularization parameter in the above sense is possible with reasonable computational costs."
"Attractor Network Dynamics Enable Preplay and Rapid Path Planning in Maze–like Environments. Rodents navigating in a well-known environment can rapidly learn and revisit observed reward locations, often after a single trial. While the mechanism for rapid path planning is unknown, the CA3 region in the hippocampus plays an important role, and emerging evidence suggests that place cell activity during hippocampal preplay periods may trace out future goal-directed trajectories. Here, we show how a particular mapping of space allows for the immediate generation of trajectories between arbitrary start and goal locations in an environment, based only on the mapped representation of the goal. We show that this representation can be implemented in a neural attractor network model, resulting in bump--like activity profiles resembling those of the CA3 region of hippocampus. Neurons tend to locally excite neurons with similar place field centers, while inhibiting other neurons with distant place field centers, such that stable bumps of activity can form at arbitrary locations in the environment. The network is initialized to represent a point in the environment, then weakly stimulated with an input corresponding to an arbitrary goal location. We show that the resulting activity can be interpreted as a gradient ascent on the value function induced by a reward at the goal location. Indeed, in networks with large place fields, we show that the network properties cause the bump to move smoothly from its initial location to the goal, around obstacles or walls. Our results illustrate that an attractor network with hippocampal-like attributes may be important for rapid path planning."
"Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend. Teaching machines to read natural language documents remains an elusive challenge. Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions posed on the contents of documents that they have seen, but until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. In this work we define a new methodology that resolves this bottleneck and provides large scale supervised reading comprehension data. This allows us to develop a class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with minimal prior knowledge of language structure."
"Principal Differences Analysis: Interpretable Characterization of Differences between Distributions. We introduce principal differences analysis for analyzing differences between high-dimensional distributions. The method operates by finding the projection that maximizes the Wasserstein divergence between the resulting univariate populations. Relying on the Cramer-Wold device, it requires no assumptions about the form of the underlying distributions, nor the nature of their inter-class differences. A sparse variant of the method is introduced to identify features responsible for the differences. We provide algorithms for both the original minimax formulation as well as its semidefinite relaxation.  In addition to deriving some convergence results, we illustrate how the approach may be applied to identify differences between cell populations in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus as manifested by single cell RNA-seq. Our broader framework extends beyond the specific choice of Wasserstein divergence."
"When are Kalman-Filter Restless Bandits Indexable?. We study the restless bandit associated with an extremely simple scalar Kalman filter model in discrete time. Under certain assumptions, we prove that the problem is {\it indexable} in the sense that the {\it Whittle index} is a non-decreasing function of the relevant belief state. In spite of the long history of this problem, this appears to be the first such proof. We use results about {\it Schur-convexity} and {\it mechanical words}, which are particularbinary strings intimately related to {\it palindromes}."
"Segregated Graphs and Marginals of Chain Graph Models. Bayesian networks are a popular representation of asymmetric (for example causal) relationships between random variables. Markov random fields (MRFs) are a complementary model of symmetric relationships used in computer vision, spatial modeling, and social and gene expression networks.  A chain graph model under the Lauritzen-Wermuth-Frydenberg interpretation (hereafter a chain graph model) generalizes both Bayesian networks and MRFs, and can represent asymmetric and symmetric relationships together.As in other graphical models, the set of marginals from distributions in a chain graph model induced by the presence of hidden variables forms a complex model.  One recent approach to the study of marginal graphical models is to consider a well-behaved supermodel.  Such a supermodel of marginals of Bayesian networks, defined only by conditional independences, and termed the ordinary Markov model, was studied at length in (Evans and Richardson, 2014).In this paper, we show that special mixed graphs which we call segregated graphs can be associated, via a Markov property, with supermodels of a marginal of chain graphs defined only by conditional independences.  Special features of segregated graphs imply the existence of a very natural factorization for these supermodels, and imply many existing results on the chain graph model, and ordinary Markov model carry over.  Our results suggest that segregated graphs define an analogue of the ordinary Markov model for marginals of chain graph models."
"Efficient Non-greedy Optimization of Decision Trees. Decision trees and randomized forests are widely used in computer vision and machine learning. Standard algorithms for decision tree induction optimize the split functions one node at a time according to some splitting criteria. This greedy procedure often leads to suboptimal trees. In this paper, we present an algorithm for optimizing the split functions at all levels of the tree jointly with the leaf parameters, based on a global objective. We show that the problem of finding optimal linear-combination (oblique) splits for decision trees is related to structured prediction with latent variables, and we formulate a convex-concave upper bound on the tree's empirical loss. Computing the gradient of the proposed surrogate objective with respect to each training exemplar is O(d^2), where d is the tree depth, and thus training deep trees is feasible. The use of stochastic gradient descent for optimization enables effective training with large datasets. Experiments on several classification benchmarks demonstrate that the resulting non-greedy decision trees outperform greedy decision tree baselines."
"Probabilistic Curve Learning: Coulomb Repulsion and the Electrostatic Gaussian Process. Learning of low dimensional structure in multidimensional data is a canonical problem in machine learning.  One common approach is to suppose that the observed data are close to a lower-dimensional smooth manifold.  There are a rich variety of manifold learning methods available, which allow mapping of data points to the manifold.  However, there is a clear lack of probabilistic methods that allow learning of the manifold along with the generative distribution of the observed data.  The best attempt is the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM), but identifiability issues lead to poor performance.  We solve these issues by proposing a novel Coulomb repulsive process (Corp) for locations of points on the manifold, inspired by physical models of electrostatic interactions among particles.  Combining this process with a GP prior for the mapping function yields a novel electrostatic GP (electroGP) process.  Focusing on the simple case of a one-dimensional manifold, we develop efficient inference algorithms, and illustrate substantially improved performance in a variety of experiments including filling in missing frames in video."
"Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Locally Consistent Reward Functions. Existing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms have assumed each expert’s demonstrated trajectory to be produced by only a single reward function. This paper presents a novel generalization of the IRL problem that allows each trajectory to be generated by multiple locally consistent reward functions, hence catering to more realistic and complex experts’ behaviors. Solving our generalized IRL problem thus involves not only learning these reward functions but also the stochastic transitions between them at any state (including unvisited states). By representing our IRL problem with a probabilistic graphical model, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be devised to iteratively learn the different reward functions and the stochastic transitions between them in order to jointly improve the likelihood of the expert’s demonstrated trajectories. As a result, the most likely partition of a trajectory into segments that are generated from different locally consistent reward functions selected by EM can be derived. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our IRL algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art EM clustering with maximum likelihood IRL, which is, interestingly, a reduced variant of our approach."
"Communication Complexity of Distributed Convex Learning and Optimization. We study the fundamental limits to communication-efficient distributed methods for convex learning and optimization, under different assumptions on the information available to individual machines, and the types of functions considered. We identify cases where existing algorithms are already worst-case optimal, as well as cases where room for further improvement is still possible. Among other things, our results indicate that without similarity between the local objective functions (due to statistical data similarity or otherwise) many communication rounds may be required, even if the machines have unbounded computational power."
"End-to-end Learning of LDA by Mirror-Descent Back Propagation over a Deep Architecture. We develop a fully discriminative learning approach for supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model using Back Propagation (i.e., BP-sLDA), which maximizes the posterior probability of the prediction variable given the input document. Different from traditional variational learning or Gibbs sampling approaches, the proposed learning method applies (i) the mirror descent algorithm for maximum a posterior inference and (ii) back propagation over a deep architecture together with stochastic gradient/mirror descent for model parameter estimation, leading to scalable and end-to-end discriminative learning of the model.  As a byproduct, we also apply this technique to develop a new learning method for the traditional unsupervised LDA model (i.e., BP-LDA). Experimental results on three real-world regression and classification tasks show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the previous supervised topic models, neural networks, and is on par with deep neural networks."
"Subset Selection by Pareto Optimization. Selecting the optimal subset from a large set of variables is a fundamental problem in various learning tasks such as feature selection, sparse regression, dictionary learning, etc. In this paper, we propose the POSS approach which employs evolutionary Pareto optimization to find a small-sized subset with good performance. We prove that for sparse regression, POSS is able to achieve the best-so-far theoretically guaranteed approximation performance efficiently. Particularly, for the \emph{Exponential Decay} subclass, POSS is proven to achieve an optimal solution. Empirical study verifies the theoretical results, and exhibits the superior performance of POSS to greedy and convex relaxation methods."
"On the Accuracy of Self-Normalized Log-Linear Models. Calculation of the log-normalizer is a major computational obstacle in applications of log-linear models with large output spaces. The problem of fast normalizer computation has therefore attracted significant attention in the theoretical and applied machine learning literature. In this paper, we analyze a recently proposed technique known as ``self-normalization'', which introduces a regularization term in training to penalize log normalizers for deviating from zero. This makes it possible to use unnormalized model scores as approximate probabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that self-normalization is extremely effective, but a theoretical understanding of why it should work, and how generally it can be applied, is largely lacking.We prove upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to self-normalization, describe classes of input distributionsthat self-normalize easily, and construct explicit examples of high-variance input distributions. Our theoretical results make predictions about the difficulty of fitting  self-normalized models to several classes of distributions, and we conclude with empirical validation of these predictions on both real and synthetic datasets."
"Regret Lower Bound and Optimal Algorithm in Finite Stochastic Partial Monitoring. Partial monitoring is a general model for sequential learning with limited feedback formalized as a game between two players. In this game, the learner chooses an action and at the same time the opponent chooses an outcome, then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal. The goal of the learner is to minimize the total loss. In this paper, we study partial monitoring with finite actions and stochastic outcomes. We derive a logarithmic distribution-dependent regret lower bound that defines the hardness of the problem. Inspired by the DMED algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010) for the multi-armed bandit problem, we propose PM-DMED, an algorithm that minimizes the distribution-dependent regret. PM-DMED significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in numerical experiments. To show the optimality of PM-DMED with respect to the regret bound, we slightly modify the algorithm by introducing a hinge function (PM-DMED-Hinge). Then, we derive an asymptotical optimal regret upper bound of PM-DMED-Hinge that matches the lower bound."
"Is Approval Voting Optimal Given Approval Votes?. Some crowdsourcing platforms ask workers to express their opinions by approving a set of k good alternatives. It seems that the only reasonable way to aggregate these k-approval votes is the approval voting rule, which simply counts the number of times each alternative was approved. We challenge this assertion by proposing a probabilistic framework of noisy voting, and asking whether approval voting yields an alternative that is most likely to be the best alternative, given k-approval votes. While the answer is generally positive, our theoretical and empirical results call attention to situations where approval voting is suboptimal."
"Regressive Virtual Metric Learning. We are interested in supervised metric learning of Mahalanobis like distances. Existing approaches mainly focus on learning a new distance using similarity and dissimilarity constraints between examples. In this paper, instead of bringing closer examples of the same class and pushing far away examples of different classes we propose to move the examples with respect to virtual points. Hence, each example is brought closer to a a priori defined virtual point reducing the number of constraints to satisfy. We show that our approach admits a closed form solution which can be kernelized. We provide a theoretical analysis showing the consistency of the approach and establishing some links with other classical metric learning methods. Furthermore we propose an efficient solution to the difficult problem of selecting virtual points based in part on recent works in optimal transport. Lastly, we evaluate our approach on several state of the art datasets."
"Analysis of Robust PCA via Local Incoherence. We investigate the robust PCA problem of decomposing an observed matrix into the sum of a low-rank and a sparse error matrices via convex programming Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). In contrast to previous studies that assume the support of the error matrix is generated by uniform Bernoulli sampling, we allow non-uniform sampling, i.e., entries of the low-rank matrix are corrupted by errors with unequal probabilities. We characterize conditions on error corruption of each individual entry based on the local incoherence of the low-rank matrix, under which correct matrix decomposition by PCP is guaranteed. Such a refined analysis of robust PCA captures how robust each entry of the low rank matrix combats error corruption. In order to deal with non-uniform error corruption, our technical proof introduces a new weighted norm and develops/exploits the concentration properties that such a norm satisfies."
"Learning to Transduce with Unbounded Memory. Recently, strong results have been demonstrated by Deep Recurrent Neural Networks on natural language transduction problems. In this paper we explore the representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to exhibit phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as machine translation. These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recurrent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues. We show that these architectures exhibit superior generalisation performance to Deep RNNs and are often able to learn the underlying generating algorithms in our transduction experiments."
"Max-Margin Deep Generative Models. Deep generative models (DGMs) are effective on learning multilayered representations of complex data and performing inference of input data by exploring the generative ability. However, little work has been done on examining or empowering the discriminative ability of DGMs on making accurate predictions. This paper presents max-margin deep generative models (mmDGMs), which explore the strongly discriminative principle of max-margin learning to improve the discriminative power of DGMs, while retaining the generative capability. We develop an efficient doubly stochastic subgradient algorithm for the piecewise linear objective. Empirical results on MNIST and SVHN datasets demonstrate that (1) max-margin learning can significantly improve the prediction performance of DGMs and meanwhile retain the generative ability; and (2) mmDGMs are competitive to the state-of-the-art fully discriminative networks by employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as both recognition and generative models."
"Spherical Random Features for Polynomial Kernels. Compact explicit feature maps provide a practical framework to scale kernel methods to large-scale learning, but deriving such maps for many types of kernels remains a challenging open problem. Among the commonly used kernels for nonlinear classification are polynomial kernels, for which low approximation error has thus far necessitated explicit feature maps of large dimensionality, especially for higher-order polynomials. Meanwhile, because polynomial kernels are unbounded, they are frequently applied to data that has been normalized to unit l2 norm. The question we address in this work is: if we know a priori that data is so normalized, can we devise a more compact map? We show that a putative affirmative answer to this question based on Random Fourier Features is impossible in this setting, and introduce a new approximation paradigm, Spherical Random Fourier (SRF) features, which circumvents these issues and delivers a compact approximation to polynomial kernels for data on the unit sphere. Compared to prior work, SRF features are less rank-deficient, more compact, and achieve better kernel approximation, especially for higher-order polynomials. The resulting predictions have lower variance and typically yield better classification accuracy."
"Rectified Factor Networks. We propose rectified factor networks (RFNs) to efficiently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input. RFN models identify rare and small events, have a low interference between code units, have a small reconstruction error, and explain the data covariance structure. RFN learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm derived from the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. We proof convergence and correctness of the RFN learning algorithm.On benchmarks, RFNs are compared to other unsupervised methods like autoencoders, RBMs, factor analysis, ICA, and PCA. In contrast to previous sparse coding methods, RFNs yield sparser codes, capture the data's covariance structure more precisely, and have a significantly smaller reconstruction error. We test RFNs as pretraining technique of deep networks on different vision datasets, where RFNs were superior to RBMs and autoencoders. On gene expression data from two pharmaceutical drug discovery studies, RFNs detected small and rare gene modules that revealed highly relevant new biological insights which were so far missed by other unsupervised methods.RFN package for GPU/CPU is available at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/rfn."
"Learning Bayesian Networks with Thousands of Variables. We present a method for learning Bayesian networks from data sets containingthousands of variables without the need for structure constraints. Our approachis made of two parts. The first is a novel algorithm that effectively explores thespace of possible parent sets of a node. It guides the exploration towards themost promising parent sets on the basis of an approximated score function thatis computed in constant time. The second part is an improvement of an existingordering-based algorithm for structure optimization. The new algorithm provablyachieves a higher score compared to its original formulation. On very large datasets containing up to ten thousand nodes, our novel approach consistently outper-forms the state of the art."
"Matrix Completion Under Monotonic Single Index Models. Most recent results in matrix completion assume that the matrix under consideration is low-rank or that the columns are in a union of low-rank subspaces. In real-world settings, however, the linear structure underlying these models is distorted by a (typically unknown) nonlinear transformation. This paper addresses the challenge of matrix completion in the face of such nonlinearities. Given a few observations of a matrix that are obtained by applying a Lipschitz, monotonic function to a low rank matrix, our task is to estimate the remaining unobserved entries. We propose a novel matrix completion method that alternates between low-rank matrix estimation and monotonic function estimation to estimate the missing matrix elements. Mean squared error bounds provide insight into how well the matrix can be estimated based on the size,  rank of the matrix and properties of the nonlinear transformation. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach."
"Visalogy: Answering Visual Analogy Questions. In this paper, we study the problem of answering visual analogy questions. These questions take the form of image A is to image B as image C is to what. Answering these questions entails discovering the mapping from image A to image B and then extending the mapping to image C and searching for the image D such that the relation from A to B holds for C to D. We pose this problem as learning an embedding that encourages pairs of analogous images with similar transformations to be close together using convolutional neural networks with a quadruple Siamese architecture. We introduce a dataset of visual analogy questions in natural images, and show first results of its kind on solving analogy questions on natural images."
"Tree-Guided MCMC Inference for Normalized Random Measure Mixture Models. Normalized random measures (NRMs) provide a broad class of discrete random measures that are often used as priors for Bayesian nonparametric models. Dirichlet process is a well-known example of NRMs. Most of posterior inference methods for NRM mixture models rely on MCMC methods since they are easy to implement and their convergence is well studied. However, MCMC often suffers from slow convergence when the acceptance rate is low. Tree-based inference is an alternative deterministic posterior inference method, where Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC) or incremental Bayesian hierarchical clustering (IBHC) have been developed for DP or NRM mixture (NRMM) models, respectively. Although IBHC is a promising method for posterior inference for NRMM models due to its efficiency and applicability to online inference, its convergence is not guaranteed since it uses heuristics that simply selects the best solution after multiple trials are made. In this paper, we present a hybrid inference algorithm for NRMM models, which combines the merits of both MCMC and IBHC. Trees built by IBHC outlinespartitions of data, which guides Metropolis-Hastings procedure to employ appropriate proposals. Inheriting the nature of MCMC, our tree-guided MCMC (tgMCMC) is guaranteed to converge, and enjoys the fast convergence thanks to the effective proposals guided by trees. Experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the benefit of our method."
"Streaming Min-max Hypergraph Partitioning. In many applications, the data is of rich structure that can be represented by a hypergraph, where the data items are represented by vertices and the associations among items are represented by hyperedges. Equivalently, we are given an input bipartite graph with two types of vertices: items, and associations (which we refer to as topics). We consider the problem of partitioning the set of items into a given number of parts such that the maximum number of topics covered by a part of the partition is minimized. This is a natural clustering problem, with various applications, e.g. partitioning of a set of  information objects such as documents, images, and videos, and load balancing in the context of computation platforms.In this paper, we focus on the streaming computation model for this problem, in which items arrive online one at a time and each item must be assigned irrevocably to a part of the partition at its arrival time. Motivated by scalability requirements, we focus on the class of streaming computation algorithms with memory limited to be at most linear in the number of the parts of the partition. We show that a greedy assignment strategy is able to recover a hidden co-clustering of items under a natural set of recovery conditions. We also report results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which demonstrate that this greedy strategy yields superior performance when compared with alternative approaches."
"Collaboratively Learning Preferences from Ordinal Data. In personalized recommendation systems, it is important to predict preferences of a user on items that have not been seen by that user yet. Similarly, in revenue management, it is important to predict outcomes of comparisons among those items that have never been compared so far. The MultiNomial Logit model, a popular discrete choice model, captures  the structure of the hidden preferences  with a low-rank matrix. In order to predict the preferences, we want to learn the underlying model from noisy observations of the low-rank matrix, collected as revealed preferences in various forms of ordinal data. A natural approach to learn such a model is to solve a convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization. We present the convex relaxation approach in two contexts of interest: collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. In both cases, we show that the convex relaxation is minimax optimal. We prove an upper bound on the resulting error with finite samples, and  provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound."
"Biologically Inspired Dynamic Textures for Probing Motion Perception. Perception is often described as a predictive process based on an optimal inference with respect to a generative model. We study here the principled construction of a generative model specifically crafted to probe motion perception. In that context, we first provide an axiomatic, biologically-driven derivation of the model. This model synthesizes random dynamic textures which are defined by stationary Gaussian distributions obtained by the random aggregation of warped patterns. Importantly, we show that this model can equivalently be described as a stochastic partial differential equation. Using this characterization of motion in images, it allows us to recast motion-energy models into a principled Bayesian inference framework. Finally, we apply these textures in order to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans. In this framework, while the likelihood is derived from the generative model, the prior is estimated from the observed results and accounts for the perceptual bias in a principled fashion."
"Generative Image Modeling Using Spatial LSTMs. Modeling the distribution of natural images is challenging, partly because of strong statistical dependencies which can extend over hundreds of pixels. Recurrent neural networks have been successful in capturing long-range dependencies in a number of problems but only recently have found their way into generative image models. We here introduce a recurrent image model based on multi-dimensional long short-term memory units which are particularly suited for image modeling due to their spatial structure. Our model scales to images of arbitrary size and its likelihood is computationally tractable. We find that it outperforms the state of the art in quantitative comparisons on several image datasets and produces promising results when used for texture synthesis and inpainting."
"Robust PCA with compressed data. The robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem seeks to separate low-rank trends from sparse outlierswithin a data matrix, that is, to approximate a $n\times d$ matrix $D$ as the sum of a low-rank matrix $L$ and a sparse matrix $S$.We examine the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem under data compression, wherethe data $Y$ is approximately given by $(L + S)\cdot C$, that is, a low-rank $+$ sparse data matrix that has been compressed to size $n\times m$ (with $m$ substantially smaller than the original dimension $d$) via multiplication witha compression matrix $C$. We give a convex program for recovering the sparse component $S$ along with the compressed low-rank component $L\cdot C$, along with upper bounds on the error of this reconstructionthat scales naturally with the compression dimension $m$ and coincides with existing results for the uncompressedsetting $m=d$. Our results can also handle error introduced through additive noise or through missing data.The scaling of dimension, compression, and signal complexity in our theoretical results is verified empirically through simulations, and we also apply our method to a data set measuring chlorine concentration acrossa network of sensors, to test its performance in practice."
"Sampling from Probabilistic Submodular Models. Submodular and supermodular functions have found wide applicability in machine learning, capturing  notions such as diversity and regularity, respectively. These notions have deep consequences for optimization, and the problem of (approximately) optimizing submodular functions has received much attention. However, beyond optimization, these notions allow specifying expressive probabilistic models that can be used to quantify predictive uncertainty via marginal inference. Prominent, well-studied special cases include Ising models and determinantal point processes, but the general class of log-submodular and log-supermodular models is much richer and little studied. In this paper, we investigate the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to perform approximate inference in general log-submodular and log-supermodular models. In particular, we consider a simple Gibbs sampling procedure, and establish two sufficient conditions, the first guaranteeing polynomial-time, and the second fast (O(nlogn)) mixing. We also evaluate the efficiency of the Gibbs sampler on three examples of such models, and compare against a recently proposed variational approach."
"COEVOLVE: A Joint Point Process Model for Information Diffusion and Network Co-evolution. Information diffusion in online social networks is affected by the underlying network topology, but it also has the power to change it. Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.We propose a temporal point process model, COEVOLVE, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces. We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter, and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives."
"Supervised Learning for Dynamical System Learning. Recently there has been substantial interest in spectral methods for learning dynamical systems. These methods are popular since they often offer a good tradeoffbetween computational and statistical efficiency. Unfortunately, they can be difficult to use and extend in practice: e.g., they can make it difficult to incorporateprior information such as sparsity or structure. To address this problem, we presenta new view of dynamical system learning: we show how to learn dynamical systems by solving a sequence of ordinary supervised learning problems, therebyallowing users to incorporate prior knowledge via standard techniques such asL 1 regularization. Many existing spectral methods are special cases of this newframework, using linear regression as the supervised learner. We demonstrate theeffectiveness of our framework by showing examples where nonlinear regressionor lasso let us learn better state representations than plain linear regression does;the correctness of these instances follows directly from our general analysis."
"Regret-Based Pruning in Extensive-Form Games. Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a leading algorithm for finding a Nash equilibrium in large zero-sum imperfect-information games. CFR is an iterative algorithm that repeatedly traverses the game tree, updating regrets at each information set.We introduce an improvement to CFR that prunes any path of play in the tree, and its descendants, that has negative regret. It revisits that sequence at the earliest subsequent CFR iteration where the regret could have become positive, had that path been explored on every iteration. The new algorithm maintains CFR's convergence guarantees while making iterations significantly faster---even if previously known pruning techniques are used in the comparison. This improvement carries over to CFR+, a recent variant of CFR. Experiments show an order of magnitude speed improvement, and the relative speed improvement increases with the size of the game."
"Fast Two-Sample Testing with Analytic Representations of Probability Measures. We propose a class of nonparametric two-sample tests with a cost linear in the sample size. Two tests are given, both  based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distance-based tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than  competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics."
"Learning to Segment Object Candidates. Recent object detection systems rely on two critical steps: (1) a set of object proposals is predicted as efficiently as possible, and (2) this set of candidate proposals is then passed to an object classifier. Such approaches have been shown they can be fast, while achieving the state of the art in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new way to generate object proposals, introducing an approach based on a discriminative convolutional network. Our model is trained jointly with two objectives: given an image patch, the first part of the system outputs a class-agnostic segmentation mask, while the second part of the system outputs the likelihood of the patch being centered on a full object. At test time, the model is efficiently applied on the whole test image and generates a set of segmentation masks, each of them being assigned with a corresponding object likelihood score. We show that our model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art object proposal algorithms. In particular, compared to previous approaches, our model obtains substantially higher object recall using fewer proposals. We also show that our model is able to generalize to unseen categories it has not seen during training. Unlike all previous approaches for generating object masks, we do not rely on edges, superpixels, or any other form of low-level segmentation."
"GP Kernels for Cross-Spectrum Analysis. Multi-output Gaussian processes provide a convenient framework for multi-task problems.  An illustrative and motivating example of a multi-task problem is multi-region electrophysiological time-series data, where experimentalists are interested in both power and phase coherence between channels.  Recently, Wilson and Adams (2013) proposed the spectral mixture (SM) kernel to model the spectral density of a single task in a Gaussian process framework.  In this paper, we develop a novel covariance kernel for multiple outputs, called the cross-spectral mixture (CSM) kernel.  This new, flexible kernel represents both the power and phase relationship between multiple observation channels.  We demonstrate the expressive capabilities of the CSM kernel through implementation of a Bayesian hidden Markov model, where the emission distribution is a multi-output Gaussian process with a CSM covariance kernel.  Results are presented for measured multi-region electrophysiological data."
"Secure Multi-party Differential Privacy. We study the problem of multi-party interactive function computation under differential privacy. In this setting, each party is interested in computing a function on its private bit and all the other parties' bits. The function to be computed can vary from one party to the other. Moreover, there could be a central observer who is interested in computing a separate function on all the parties' bits. Differential privacy ensures that there remains an uncertainty in any party's bit even when given the transcript of interactions and all other parties' bits. Performance at each party is measured via the accuracy of the function to be computed. We allow for an arbitrary cost metric to measure the distortion between the true and the computed function values. Our main result is the optimality of a simple non-interactive protocol: each party randomizes its bit (sufficiently) and shares the privatized version with the other parties. This optimality result is very general: it holds for all types of functions, heterogeneous privacy conditions on the parties, all types of cost metrics, and both average and worst-case (over the inputs) measures of accuracy."
"Spatial Transformer Networks. Convolutional Neural Networks define an exceptionallypowerful class of model, but are still limited by the lack of abilityto be spatially invariant to the input data in a computationally and parameterefficient manner. In this work we introduce a new learnable module, theSpatial Transformer, which explicitly allows the spatial manipulation ofdata within the network. This differentiable module can be insertedinto existing convolutional architectures, giving neural networks the ability toactively spatially transform feature maps, conditional on the feature map itself,without any extra training supervision or modification to the optimisation process. We show that the useof spatial transformers results in models which learn invariance to translation,scale, rotation and more generic warping, resulting in state-of-the-artperformance on several benchmarks, and for a numberof classes of transformations."
"Anytime Influence Bounds and the Explosive Behavior of Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks. The paper studies transition phenomena in information cascades observed along a diffusion process over some graph. We introduce the Laplace Hazard matrix and show that its spectral radius fully characterizes the dynamics of the contagion both in terms of influence and of explosion time. Using this concept, we prove tight non-asymptotic bounds for the influence of a set of nodes, and we also provide an in-depth analysis of the critical time after which the contagion becomes super-critical. Our contributions include formal definitions and tight lower bounds of critical explosion time. We illustrate the relevance of our theoretical results through several examples of information cascades used in epidemiology and viral marketing models. Finally, we provide a series of numerical experiments for various types of networks which confirm the tightness of the theoretical bounds."
"Multi-class SVMs: From Tighter Data-Dependent Generalization Bounds to Novel Algorithms. This paper studies the generalization performance of multi-class classification algorithms, for which we obtain, for the first time, a data-dependent generalization error bound with a logarithmic dependence on the class size, substantially improving the state-of-the-art linear dependence in the existing data-dependent generalization analysis. The theoretical analysis motivates us to introduce a new multi-class classification machine based on lp-norm regularization, where the parameter p controls the complexity of the corresponding bounds. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm based on Fenchel duality theory. Benchmarks on several real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant accuracy gains over the state of the art."
"High-dimensional neural spike train analysis with generalized count linear dynamical systems. Latent factor models have been widely used to analyze simultaneous recordings of spike trains from large, heterogeneous neural populations.  These models assume  the signal of interest in the population is a low-dimensional latent intensity that evolves over time, which is observed in high dimension via noisy point-process observations.  These techniques have been well used to capture neural correlations across a population and to provide a smooth, denoised, and concise representation of high-dimensional spiking data.  One limitation of many current models is that the observation model is assumed to be Poisson, which lacks the flexibility to capture under- and over-dispersion that is common in recorded neural data, thereby introducing bias into estimates of covariance.  Here we develop the generalized count linear dynamical system, which relaxes the Poisson assumption by using a more general exponential family for count data.  In addition to containing Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial, and other common count distributions as special cases, we show that this model can be tractably learned by extending recent advances in variational inference techniques.  We apply our model to data from primate motor cortex and demonstrate performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, both in capturing the variance structure of the data and in held-out prediction."
"Learning with a Wasserstein Loss. Learning to predict multi-label outputs is challenging, but in many problems there is a natural metric on the outputs that can be used to improve predictions. In this paper we develop a loss function for multi-label learning, based on the Wasserstein distance. The Wasserstein distance provides a natural notion of dissimilarity for probability measures. Although optimizing with respect to the exact Wasserstein distance is costly, recent work has described a regularized approximation that is efficiently computed. We describe an efficient learning algorithm based on this regularization, as well as a novel extension of the Wasserstein distance from probability measures to unnormalized measures. We also describe a statistical learning bound for the loss. The Wasserstein loss can encourage smoothness of the predictions with respect to a chosen metric on the output space. We demonstrate this property on a real-data tag prediction problem, using the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons dataset, outperforming a baseline that doesn't use the metric."
"b-bit Marginal Regression. We consider the problem of sparse signal recovery from $m$ linear measurements quantized to $b$ bits. $b$-bit Marginal Regression is proposed as recovery algorithm. We study the question of choosing $b$ in the setting of a given budget of bits $B = m \cdot b$ and derive a single easy-to-compute expression characterizing the trade-off between $m$ and $b$. The choice $b = 1$ turns out to be optimal for estimating the unit vector corresponding to the signal for any level of additive Gaussian noise before quantization as well as for adversarial noise. For $b \geq 2$, we show that Lloyd-Max quantization constitutes an optimal quantization scheme and that the norm of the signal canbe estimated consistently by maximum likelihood."
"Natural Neural Networks. We introduce Natural Neural Networks, a novel family of algorithms that speed up convergence by adapting their internal representation during training to improve conditioning of the Fisher matrix. In particular, we show a specific example that employs a simple and efficient reparametrization of the neural network weights by implicitly whitening the representation obtained at each layer, while preserving the feed-forward computation of the network. Such networks can be trained efficiently via the proposed Projected Natural Gradient Descent algorithm (PRONG), which amortizes the cost of these reparametrizations over many parameter updates and is closely related to the Mirror Descent online learning algorithm. We highlight the benefits of our method on both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, and showcase its scalability by training on the large-scale ImageNet Challenge dataset."
"Optimization Monte Carlo: Efficient and Embarrassingly Parallel Likelihood-Free Inference. We describe an embarrassingly parallel, anytime Monte Carlo method for likelihood-free models.  The algorithm starts with the view that the stochasticity of the pseudo-samples generated by the simulator can be controlled externally by a vector of random numbers u, in such a way that the outcome, knowing u, is deterministic.  For each instantiation of u we run an optimization procedure to minimize the distance between summary statistics of the simulator and the data. After reweighing these samples using the prior and the Jacobian (accounting for the change of volume in transforming from the space of summary statistics to the space of parameters) we show that this weighted ensemble represents a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution. The procedure can be run embarrassingly parallel (each node handling one sample) and anytime (by allocating resources to the worst performing sample). The procedure is validated on six experiments."
"Adaptive Primal-Dual Splitting Methods for Statistical Learning and Image Processing. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is an important tool for solving complex optimization problems, but it involves minimization sub-steps that are often difficult to solve efficiently.   The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) method is a powerful alternative that often has simpler substeps than ADMM, thus producing lower complexity solvers. Despite the flexibility of this method, PDHG is often impractical because it requires the careful choice of multiple stepsize parameters. There is often no intuitive way to choose these parameters to maximize efficiency, or even achieve convergence.  We propose self-adaptive stepsize rules that automatically tune PDHG parameters for optimal convergence.  We rigorously analyze our methods, and identify convergence rates.  Numerical experiments show that adaptive PDHG has strong advantages over non-adaptive methods in terms of both efficiency and simplicity for the user."
"On some provably correct cases of variational inference for topic models. Variational inference is an efficient, popular heuristic used in the context of latent variable models. We provide the first analysis of instances where variational inference algorithms converge to the global optimum, in the setting of topic models. Our initializations are natural, one of them being used in LDA-c, the mostpopular implementation of variational inference.In addition to providing intuition into why this heuristic might work in practice, the multiplicative, rather than additive nature of the variational inference updates forces us to usenon-standard proof arguments, which we believe might be of general theoretical interest."
"Collaborative Filtering with Graph Information: Consistency and Scalable Methods. Low rank matrix completion plays a fundamental role in collaborative filtering applications, the key idea being that the variables lie in a smaller subspace than the ambient space. Often, additional information about the variables is known, and it is reasonable to assume that incorporating this information will lead to better predictions. We tackle the problem of matrix completion when pairwise relationships among variables are known, via a graph. We formulate and derive a highly efficient, conjugate gradient based alternating minimization scheme that solves optimizations with over 55 million observations up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art (stochastic) gradient-descent based methods. On the theoretical front, we show that such methods generalize weighted nuclear norm formulations, and derive statistical consistency guarantees. We validate our results on both real and synthetic datasets."
"Combinatorial Bandits Revisited. This paper investigates stochastic and adversarial combinatorial multi-armed bandit problems. In the stochastic setting under semi-bandit feedback, we derive a problem-specific regret lower bound, and discuss its scaling with the dimension of the decision space. We propose ESCB, an algorithm that efficiently exploits the structure of the problem and provide a finite-time analysis of its regret. ESCB has better performance guarantees than existing algorithms, and significantly outperforms these algorithms in practice. In the adversarial setting under bandit feedback, we propose CombEXP, an algorithm with the same regret scaling as state-of-the-art algorithms, but with lower computational complexity for some combinatorial problems."
"Variational Information Maximisation for Intrinsically Motivated Reinforcement Learning. The mutual information is a core statistical quantity that has applications in all areas of machine learning, whether this is in training of density models over multiple data modalities, in maximising the efficiency of noisy transmission channels, or when learning behaviour policies for exploration by artificial agents. Most learning algorithms that involve optimisation of the mutual information rely on the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm --- an enumerative algorithm with exponential complexity that is not suitable for modern machine learning applications. This paper provides a new approach for scalable optimisation of the mutual information by merging techniques from variational inference and deep learning. We develop our approach by focusing on the problem of intrinsically-motivated learning, where the mutual information forms the definition of a well-known internal drive known as empowerment. Using a variational lower bound on the mutual information, combined with convolutional networks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic optimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information maximisation and empowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions."
"A Structural Smoothing Framework For Robust Graph Comparison. In this paper, we propose a general smoothing framework for graph kernels by  taking \textit{structural similarity} into account, and apply it to  derive smoothed variants of popular graph kernels. Our framework is inspired by state-of-the-art smoothing  techniques used in natural language processing (NLP). However, unlike  NLP applications which primarily deal with strings, we show how one  can apply smoothing to a richer class of inter-dependent  sub-structures that naturally arise in graphs. Moreover, we discuss  extensions of the Pitman-Yor process that can be adapted to smooth  structured objects thereby leading to novel graph kernels. Our  kernels are able to tackle the diagonal dominance problem, while  respecting the structural similarity between sub-structures,   especially under the presence of edge or label noise.  Experimental evaluation shows that not only our kernels outperform  the unsmoothed variants, but also achieve statistically significant  improvements in classification accuracy over several other graph  kernels that have been recently proposed in literature. Our kernels  are competitive in terms of runtime, and offer a viable option for  practitioners."
"Competitive Distribution Estimation: Why is Good-Turing Good. Estimating distributions over large alphabets is a fundamental machine-learning tenet. Yet no method is known to estimate all distributions well.  For example, add-constant estimators are nearly min-max optimal but often perform poorly in practice, and practical estimators such as absolute discounting, Jelinek-Mercer, and Good-Turing are not known to be near optimal for essentially any distribution.We describe the first universally near-optimal probability estimators. For every discrete distribution, they are provably nearly the best in the following two competitive ways. First they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the distribution up to a permutation. Second, they estimate every distribution nearly as well as the best estimator designed with prior knowledge of the exact distribution, but as all natural estimators, restricted to assign the same probability to all symbols appearing the same number of times.Specifically, for distributions over $k$ symbols and $n$ samples, we show that for both comparisons, a simple variant of Good-Turing estimator is always within KL divergence of $(3+o(1))/n^{1/3}$ from the best estimator, and that a more involved estimator is within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\min(k/n,1/\sqrt n))$.  Conversely, we show that any estimator must have a KL divergence $\ge\tilde\Omega(\min(k/n,1/ n^{2/3}))$ over the best estimator for the first comparison, and $\ge\tilde\Omega(\min(k/n,1/\sqrt{n}))$ for the second."
"Efficient Learning by Directed Acyclic Graph For Resource Constrained Prediction. We study the problem of reducing test-time acquisition costs in classification systems. Our goal is to learn decision rules that adaptively select sensors for each example as necessary to make a confident prediction. We model our system as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where internal nodes correspond to sensor subsets and decision functions at each node choose whether to acquire a new sensor or classify using the available measurements. This problem can be naturally posed as an empirical risk minimization over training data. Rather than jointly optimizing such a highly coupled and non-convex problem over all decision nodes, we propose an efficient algorithm motivated by dynamic programming. We learn node policies in the DAG by reducing the global objective to a series of cost sensitive learning problems. Our approach is computationally efficient and has proven guarantees of convergence to the optimal system for a fixed architecture. In addition, we present an extension to map other budgeted learning problems with large number of sensors to our DAG architecture and demonstrate empirical performance exceeding state-of-the-art algorithms for data composed of both few and many sensors."
A hybrid sampler for Poisson-Kingman mixture models. This paper concerns the introduction of a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. We present a novel and compact way of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model such that while explicitly representing this infinite component it has less memory and storage requirements than previous MCMC schemes. We describe  comparative  simulation  results  demonstrating  the  efficacy  of  the  proposed MCMC algorithm against existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers.
"An Active Learning Framework using Sparse-Graph Codes for Sparse Polynomials and Graph Sketching. Let $f: \{-1,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be an $n$-variate polynomial consisting of $2^n$ monomials, in which only $s\ll 2^n$ coefficients are non-zero. The goal is to learn the polynomial by querying the values of $f$. We introduce an active learning framework that is associated with a low query cost and computational runtime. The significant savings are enabled by leveraging sampling strategies based on modern coding theory, specifically, the design and analysis of {\it sparse-graph codes}, such as Low-Density-Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, which represent the state-of-the-art of modern packet communications. More significantly, we show how this design perspective leads to exciting, and to the best of our knowledge, largely unexplored intellectual connections between learning and coding. The key is to relax the worst-case assumption with an ensemble-average setting, where the polynomial is assumed to be drawn uniformly at random from the ensemble of all polynomials (of a given size $n$ and sparsity $s$). Our framework succeeds with high probability with respect to the polynomial ensemble with sparsity up to $s={O}(2^{\delta n})$ for any $\delta\in(0,1)$, where $f$ is exactly learned using ${O}(ns)$ queries in time ${O}(n s \log s)$, even if the queries are perturbed by Gaussian noise. We further apply the proposed framework to graph sketching, which is the problem of inferring sparse graphs by querying graph cuts. By writing the cut function as a polynomial and exploiting the graph structure, we propose a sketching algorithm to learn the an arbitrary $n$-node unknown graph using only few cut queries, which scales {\it almost linearly} in the number of edges and {\it sub-linearly} in the graph size $n$. Experiments on real datasets show significant reductions in the runtime and query complexity compared with competitive schemes."
"Local Smoothness in Variance Reduced Optimization. Abstract We propose a family of non-uniform sampling strategies to provably speed up a class of stochastic optimization algorithms with linear convergence including Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) and Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA). For a large family of penalized empirical risk minimization problems, our methods exploit data dependent local smoothness of the loss functions near the optimum, while maintaining convergence guarantees. Our bounds are the first to quantify the advantage gained from local smoothness which are significant for some problems significantly better. Empirically, we provide thorough numerical results to back up our theory. Additionally we present algorithms exploiting local smoothness in more aggressive ways, which perform even better in practice."
"Saliency, Scale and Information: Towards a Unifying Theory. In this paper we present a definition for visual saliency grounded in information theory. This proposal is shown to relate to a variety of classic research contributions in scale-space theory, interest point detection, bilateral filtering, and to existing models of visual saliency. Based on the proposed definition of visual saliency, we demonstrate results competitive with the state-of-the art for both prediction of human fixations, and segmentation of salient objects. We also characterize different properties of this model including robustness to image transformations, and extension to a wide range of other data types with 3D mesh models serving as an example. Finally, we relate this proposal more generally to the role of saliency computation in visual information processing and draw connections to putative mechanisms for saliency computation in human vision."
"Fighting Bandits with a New Kind of Smoothness. We focus on the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem. The EXP3 algorithm of Auer et al. (2003) was shown to have a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T N \log N})$, where $T$ is the time horizon and $N$ is the number of available actions (arms). More recently, Audibert and Bubeck (2009) improved the bound by a logarithmic factor via an entirely different method. In the present work, we provide a new set of analysis tools, using the notion of convex smoothing, to provide several novel algorithms with optimal guarantees. First we show that regularization via the Tsallis entropy matches the minimax rate of Audibert and Bubeck (2009) with an even tighter constant; it also fully generalizes EXP3. Second we show that a wide class of perturbation methods lead to near-optimal bandit algorithms as long as a simple condition on the perturbation distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is met: one needs that the hazard function of $\mathcal{D}$ remain bounded. The Gumbel, Weibull, Frechet, Pareto, and Gamma distributions all satisfy this key property; interestingly, the Gaussian and Uniform distributions do not."
"Beyond Sub-Gaussian Measurements: High-Dimensional Structured Estimation with Sub-Exponential Designs. We consider the problem of high-dimensional structured estimation with norm-regularized estimators, such as Lasso, when the design matrix and noise are drawn from sub-exponential distributions.Existing results only consider sub-Gaussian designs and noise, and both the sample complexity and non-asymptotic estimation error have been shown to depend on the Gaussian width of suitable sets. In contrast, for the sub-exponential setting, we show that the sample complexity and the estimation error will depend on the exponential width of the corresponding sets, and the analysis holds for any norm. Further, using generic chaining, we show that the exponential width for any set will be at most $\sqrt{\log p}$ times the Gaussian width of the set, yielding Gaussian width based results even for the sub-exponential case. Further, for certain popular estimators, viz Lasso and Group Lasso, using a VC-dimension based analysis, we show that the sample complexity will in fact be the same order as Gaussian designs. Our general analysis and results are the first in the sub-exponential setting, and are readily applicable to special sub-exponential families such as log-concave and extreme-value distributions."
"Spectral Norm Regularization of Orthonormal Representations for Graph Transduction. Recent literature~\cite{ando} suggests that embedding a graph on an unit sphere leads to better generalization for graph transduction. However, the choice of optimal embedding and an efficient algorithm to compute the same remains open. In this paper, we show that orthonormal representations, a class of unit-sphere graph embeddings are PAC learnable. Existing PAC-based analysis do not  apply as the VC dimension of the function class is infinite. We propose an alternative PAC-based bound, which do not depend on the VC dimension of the underlying function class, but is related to the famous Lov\'{a}sz~$\vartheta$ function. The main contribution of the paper is SPORE, a SPectral regularized ORthonormal Embedding for graph transduction, derived from the PAC bound. SPORE is posed as a non-smooth convex function over an \emph{elliptope}. These problems are usually solved as semi-definite programs (SDPs) with time complexity $O(n^6)$.  We present,  Infeasible Inexact proximal~(IIP): an Inexact proximal method which performs subgradient procedure on an approximate projection, not necessarily feasible. IIP is more scalable than SDP, has an $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence, and is generally applicable whenever a suitable approximate projection is available. We use IIP to compute SPORE where the approximate projection step is computed by FISTA, an accelerated gradient descent procedure. We show that the method has a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$. The proposed algorithm easily scales to 1000's of vertices, while the standard SDP computation does not scale beyond few hundred vertices. Furthermore, the analysis presented here easily extends to the multiple graph setting."
"Convolutional Networks on Graphs for Learning Molecular Fingerprints. We introduce a convolutional neural network that operates directly on graphs.These networks allow end-to-end learning of prediction pipelines whose inputs are graphs of arbitrary size and shape.The architecture we present generalizes standard molecular feature extraction methods based on circular fingerprints.We show that these data-driven features are more interpretable, and have better predictive performance on a variety of tasks."
"Mixed Robust/Average Submodular Partitioning: Fast Algorithms, Guarantees, and Applications. We investigate two novel mixed robust/average-case submodular data partitioning problems that we collectively call Submodular Partitioning. These problems generalize purely robust instances of the problem, namely max-min submodular fair allocation (SFA) and \emph{min-max submodular load balancing} (SLB), and also average-case instances, that is the submodular welfare problem (SWP) and submodular multiway partition (SMP). While the robust versions have been studied in the theory community, existing work has focused on tight approximation guarantees, and the resultant algorithms are not generally scalable to large real-world applications. This contrasts the average case instances, where most of the algorithms are scalable.  In the present paper, we bridge this gap, by proposing several new algorithms (including greedy, majorization-minimization, minorization-maximization, and relaxation algorithms) that not only scale to large datasets but that also achieve theoretical approximation guarantees comparable to the state-of-the-art. We moreover provide new scalable algorithms that apply to additive combinations of the robust and average-case objectives. We show that these problems have many applications in machine learning (ML), including data partitioning and load balancing for distributed ML, data clustering, and image segmentation. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on real-world problems involving data partitioning for distributed optimization (of convex and deep neural network objectives), and also purely unsupervised image segmentation."
"Tractable Learning for Complex Probability Queries. Tractable learning aims to learn probabilistic models where inference is guaranteed to be efficient. However, the particular class of queries that is tractable depends on the model and underlying representation.  Usually this class is MPE or conditional probabilities $\Pr(\xs|\ys)$ for joint assignments~$\xs,\ys$. We propose a tractable learner that guarantees efficient inference for a broader class of queries. It simultaneously learns a Markov network and its tractable circuit representation, in order to guarantee and measure tractability. Our approach differs from earlier work by using Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) as the tractable language instead of Arithmetic Circuits (AC). SDDs have desirable properties, which more general representations such as ACs lack, that enable basic primitives for Boolean circuit compilation. This allows us to support a broader class of complex probability queries, including counting, threshold, and parity, in polytime."
"StopWasting My Gradients: Practical SVRG. We present and analyze several strategies for improving the performance ofstochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods. We first show that theconvergence rate of these methods can be preserved under a decreasing sequenceof errors in the control variate, and use this to derive variants of SVRG that usegrowing-batch strategies to reduce the number of gradient calculations requiredin the early iterations. We further (i) show how to exploit support vectors to reducethe number of gradient computations in the later iterations, (ii) prove that thecommonly–used regularized SVRG iteration is justified and improves the convergencerate, (iii) consider alternate mini-batch selection strategies, and (iv) considerthe generalization error of the method."
"Mind the Gap: A Generative Approach to Interpretable Feature Selection and Extraction. We present the Mind the Gap Model (MGM), an approach for interpretable feature extraction and selection.  By placing interpretability criteria directly into the model, we allow for the model to both optimize parameters related to interpretability and to directly report a global set of distinguishable dimensions to assist with further data exploration and hypothesis generation. MGM extracts distinguishing features on real-world datasets of animal features, recipes ingredients, and disease co-occurrence.  It also maintains or improves performance when compared to related approaches.  We perform a user study with domain experts to show the MGM's ability to help with dataset exploration."
"A Normative Theory of Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction in Neural Networks. To make sense of the world our brains must analyze high-dimensional datasets streamed by our sensory organs. Because such analysis begins with dimensionality reduction, modelling early sensory processing requires biologically plausible online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory inputs is variable there is a need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here, we derive biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input covariance matrix. We formulate three objective functions which, in the offline setting, are optimized by the projections of the input dataset onto its principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix. In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded, ii) hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding adaptive algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in networks with biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the last two networks, neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits."
"On the Convergence of Stochastic Gradient MCMC Algorithms with High-Order Integrators. Recent advances in Bayesian learning with large-scale data have witnessed emergence of stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC), such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD), stochastic gradient Hamiltonian MCMC (SGHMC), and the stochastic gradient thermostat. While finite-time convergence properties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been studied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In this paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and develop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their asymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence rates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order integrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric splitting integrator, the mean square error (MSE) of the posterior average for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$ iterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler integrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs are also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size counterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method in two large-scale real applications."
"Learning structured densities via infinite dimensional exponential families. Learning the structure of a probabilistic graphical models is a well studied problem in the machine learning community due to its importance in many applications. Current approaches are mainly focused on learning the structure under restrictive parametric assumptions, which limits the applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the structure of a probabilistic graphical model without assuming a particular parametric model. We consider probabilities that are members of an infinite dimensional exponential family, which is parametrized by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H and its kernel $k$. One difficulty in learning nonparametric densities is evaluation of the normalizing constant. In order to avoid this issue, our procedure minimizes the penalized score matching objective. We show how to efficiently minimize the proposed objective using existing group lasso solvers. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure recovers the graph structure with high-probability under mild conditions. Simulation studies illustrate ability of our procedure to recover the true graph structure without the knowledge of the data generating process."
"Are You Talking to a Machine? Dataset and Methods for Multilingual Image Question. In this paper, we present the mQA model, which is able to answer questions about the content of an image. The answer can be a sentence, a phrase or a single word. Our model contains four components: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to extract the question representation, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three components and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset to train and evaluate our mQA model. It contains over 150,000 images and 310,000 freestyle Chinese question-answer pairs and their English translations. The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. Specifically, we mix the answers provided by humans and our model. The human judges need to distinguish our model from the human. They will also provide a score (i.e. 0, 1, 2, the larger the better) indicating the quality of the answer. We propose strategies to monitor the quality of this evaluation process. The experiments show that in 64.7% of cases, the human judges cannot distinguish our model from humans. The average score is 1.454 (1.918 for human). The details of this work, including the FM-IQA dataset, can be found on the project page: \url{http://idl.baidu.com/FM-IQA.html}."
"Variance Reduced Stochastic Gradient Descent with Neighbors. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a workhorse in machine learning, yet it is also known to be slow relative to steepest descent.  Recently, variance reduction techniques such as SVRG and SAGA have been proposed to overcome this weakness. With asymptotically vanishing variance, a constant step size can be maintained, resulting in geometric convergence rates. However, these methods are either based on occasional computations of full gradients at pivot points (SVRG), or on keeping per data point corrections in memory (SAGA). This has the disadvantage that one cannot employ these methods in a streaming setting and that speed-ups relative to SGD may need a certain number of epochs in order to materialize. This paper investigates a new class of algorithms that can exploit neighborhood structure in the training data to share and re-use information about past stochastic gradients across data points. While not meant to be offering advantages in an asymptotic setting, there are significant benefits in the transient optimization phase, in particular in a streaming or single-epoch setting. We investigate this family of algorithms in a thorough analysis and show supporting experimental results. As a side-product we provide a simple and unified proof technique for a broad class of variance reduction algorithms."
"Sample Efficient Path Integral Control under Uncertainty. We present a data-driven stochastic optimal control framework that is derived using the path integral (PI) control approach. We find iterative control laws analytically without a priori policy parameterization based on probabilistic representation of the learned dynamics model. The proposed algorithm operates in a forward-backward sweep manner which differentiate it from other PI-related methods that perform forward sampling to find open-loop optimal controls.    Our method uses significantly less sampled data to find analytic control laws compared to other approaches within the PI control family that rely on extensive sampling from given dynamics models or trials on physical systems in a model-free fashion. In addition, the learned controllers can be generalized to new tasks without re-sampling based on the compositionality theory for the linearly-solvable optimal control framework.We provide experimental results on three different systems and comparisons with state-of-the-art model-based methods to demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed framework."
"Stochastic Expectation Propagation. Expectation propagation (EP) is a deterministic approximation algorithm that is often used to perform approximate Bayesian parameter learning. EP approximates the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local-approximations that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer analytic and computational advantages over other approximations, such as Variational Inference (VI), and is the method of choice for a number of models. The local nature of EP appears to make it an ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on large models in large-scale datasets settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in this context: the number approximating factors needs to increase with the number of data-points, N, which often entails a prohibitively large memory overhead. This paper presents an extension to EP, called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP), that maintains a global posterior approximation (like VI) but updates it in a local way (like EP).  Experiments on a number of canonical learning problems using synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor of N. SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning in the large model, large dataset setting."
"Exactness of Approximate MAP Inference in Continuous MRFs. Computing the MAP assignment in graphical models is generally intractable.  As a result, for discrete graphical models, the MAP problem is often approximated using linear programming relaxations.  Much research has focused on characterizing when these LP relaxations are tight, and while they are relatively well-understood in the discrete case, only a few results are known for their continuous analog.  In this work, we use graph covers to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for continuous MAP relaxations to be tight.  We use this characterization to give simple proofs that the relaxation is tight for log-concave decomposable and log-supermodular decomposable models.  We conclude by exploring the relationship between these two seemingly distinct classes of functions and providing specific conditions under which the MAP relaxation can and cannot be tight."
"Scale Up Nonlinear Component Analysis with Doubly Stochastic Gradients. Nonlinear component analysis such as kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) and kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) are widely used in machine learning, statistics and data analysis, but they can not scale up to big datasets. Recent attempts have employed random feature approximations to convert the problem to the primal form for linear computational complexity. However, to obtain high quality solutions, the number of random features should be the same order of magnitude as the number of data points, making such approach not directly applicable to the regime with millions of data points.We propose a simple, computationally efficient, and memory friendly algorithm based on the ``doubly stochastic gradients'' to scale up a range of kernel nonlinear component analysis, such as kernel PCA, CCA and SVD. Despite the \emph{non-convex} nature of these problems, our method enjoys theoretical guarantees that it converges at the rate $\Otil(1/t)$ to the global optimum, even for the top $k$ eigen subspace. Unlike many alternatives, our algorithm does not require explicit orthogonalization, which is infeasible on big datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm on large scale synthetic and real world datasets."
"Generalization in Adaptive Data Analysis and Holdout Reuse. Overfitting is the bane of data analysts, even when data are plentiful. Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused.  An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in (Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating expectations of adaptively chosen functions.In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout (or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning algorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a  holdout set adaptively multiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We give an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively chosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a simple synthetic experiment.We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive data analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach  in (Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis. We then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be used to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings. Finally, we demonstrate that these incomparable approaches can be unified via the notion of approximate max-information that we introduce. This, in particular, allows the preservation of statistical validity guarantees even when an analyst adaptively composes algorithms which have guarantees based on either of the two approaches."
"Market Scoring Rules Act As Opinion Pools For Risk-Averse Agents. A market scoring rule (MSR) – a popular tool for designing algorithmic prediction markets – is an incentive-compatible mechanism for the aggregation of probabilistic beliefs from myopic risk-neutral agents. In this paper, we add to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the precise manner in which the price process induced by a MSR incorporates private information from agents who deviate from the assumption of risk-neutrality. We first establish that, for a myopic trading agent with a risk-averse utility function, a MSR satisfying mild regularity conditions elicits the agent’s risk-neutral probability conditional on the latest market state rather than her true subjective probability. Hence, we show that a MSR under these conditions effectively behaves like a more traditional method of belief aggregation, namely an opinion pool, for agents’ true probabilities. In particular, the logarithmic market scoring rule acts as a logarithmic pool for constant absolute risk aversion utility agents, and as a linear pool for an atypical budget-constrained agent utility with decreasing absolute risk aversion. We also point out the interpretation of a market maker under these conditions as a Bayesian learner even when agent beliefs are static."
"Sparse Linear Programming via Primal and Dual Augmented Coordinate Descent. Over the past decades, Linear Programming (LP) has been widely used in different areas and considered as one of the mature technologies in numerical optimization. However, the complexity offered by state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e. interior-point method and primal, dual simplex methods) is still unsatisfactory for problems in machine learning with huge number of variables and constraints. In this paper, we investigate a general LP algorithm based on the combination of Augmented Lagrangian and Coordinate Descent (AL-CD), giving an iteration complexity of $O((\log(1/\epsilon))^2)$ with $O(nnz(A))$ cost per iteration, where $nnz(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in the $m\times n$ constraint matrix $A$, and in practice, one can further reduce cost per iteration to the order of non-zeros in columns (rows) corresponding to the active primal (dual) variables through an active-set strategy. The algorithm thus yields a tractable alternative to standard LP methods for large-scale problems of sparse solutions and $nnz(A)\ll mn$. We conduct experiments on large-scale LP instances from $\ell_1$-regularized multi-class SVM, Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation, and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, where the proposed approach finds solutions of $10^{-3}$ precision orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations of interior-point and simplex methods."
"Training Very Deep Networks. Theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the depth of neural networks is crucial for their success. However, training becomes more difficult as depth increases, and training of very deep networks remains an open problem. Here we introduce a new architecture designed to overcome this. Our so-called highway networks allow unimpeded information flow across many layers on information highways. They are inspired by Long Short-Term Memory recurrent networks and use adaptive gating units to regulate the information flow. Even with hundreds of layers, highway networks can be trained directly through simple gradient descent. This enables the study of extremely deep and efficient architectures."
"Bayesian Active Model Selection with an Application to Automated Audiometry. We introduce a novel information-theoretic approach for active model selection and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world application. Although our method can work with arbitrary models, we focus on actively learning the appropriate structure for Gaussian process (GP) models with arbitrary observation likelihoods. We then apply this framework to rapid screening for noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), a widespread and preventible disability, if diagnosed early. We construct a GP model for pure-tone audiometric responses of patients with NIHL. Using this and a previously published model for healthy responses, the proposed method is shown to be capable of diagnosing the presence or absence of NIHL with drastically fewer samples than existing approaches. Further, the method is extremely fast and enables the diagnosis to be performed in real time."
"Particle Gibbs for Infinite Hidden Markov Models. Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM's) are an attractive, nonparametric generalization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically infer the number of hidden states in the system.  However, due to the infinite-dimensional nature of the transition dynamics, performing inference in the iHMM is difficult. In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to resample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient proposal optimized for iHMMs, and leverages ancestor sampling to improve the mixing of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant convergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets."
"Learning spatiotemporal trajectories from manifold-valued longitudinal data. We propose a Bayesian mixed-effects model to learn typical scenarios of changes from longitudinal manifold-valued data, namely repeated measurements of the same objects or individuals at several points in time. The model allows to estimate a group-average trajectory in the space of measurements. Random variations of this trajectory result from spatiotemporal transformations, which allow changes in the direction of the trajectory and in the pace at which trajectories are followed. The use of the tools of Riemannian geometry allows to derive a generic algorithm for any kind of data with smooth constraints, which lie therefore on a Riemannian manifold. Stochastic approximations of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters in this highly non-linear setting.The method is used to estimate a data-driven model of the progressive impairments of cognitive functions during the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Experimental results show that the model correctly put into correspondence the age at which each individual was diagnosed with the disease, thus validating the fact that it effectively estimated a normative scenario of disease progression. Random effects provide unique insights into the variations in the ordering and timing of the succession of cognitive impairments across different individuals."
"A Bayesian Framework for Modeling Confidence in Perceptual Decision Making. The degree of confidence in one's choice or decision is a critical aspect of perceptual decision making. Attempts to quantify a decision maker's confidence by measuring accuracy in a task have yielded limited success because confidence and accuracy are typically not equal. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian framework to model confidence in perceptual decision making. We show that this model, based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), is able to predict confidence of a decision maker based only on the data available to the experimenter. We test our model on two experiments on confidence-based decision making involving the well-known random dots motion discrimination task. In both experiments, we show that our model's predictions closely match experimental data. Additionally, our model is also consistent with other phenomena such as the hard-easy effect in perceptual decision making."
"Path-SGD: Path-Normalized Optimization in Deep Neural Networks. We revisit the choice of SGD for training deep neural networks by reconsidering the appropriate geometry in which to optimize the weights.  We argue for a geometry invariant to rescaling of weights that does not affect the output of the network, and suggest Path-SGD, which is an approximate steepest descent method with respect to a path-wise regularizer related to max-norm regularization.  Path-SGD is easy and efficient to implement and leads to empirical gains over SGD and AdaGrad."
"On the consistency theory of high dimensional variable screening. Variable screening is a fast dimension reduction technique for assisting high dimensional feature selection. As a preselection method, it selects a moderate size subset of candidate variables for further refining via feature selection to produce the final model. The performance of variable screening depends on both computational efficiency and the ability to dramatically reduce the number of variables without discarding the important ones. When the data dimension $p$ is substantially larger than the sample size $n$, variable screening becomes crucial as 1) Faster feature selection algorithms are needed; 2) Conditions guaranteeing selection consistency might fail to hold.This article studies a class of linear screening methods and establishes consistency theory for this special class. In particular, we prove the restricted diagonally dominant (RDD) condition is a necessary and sufficient condition for strong screening consistency. As concrete examples, we show two screening methods $SIS$ and $HOLP$ are both strong screening consistent (subject to additional constraints) with large probability if $n > O((\rho s + \sigma/\tau)^2\log p)$ under random designs. In addition, we relate the RDD condition to the irrepresentable condition, and highlight limitations of $SIS$."
"End-To-End Memory Networks. We introduce a neural network with a recurrent attention model over a possibly large external memory. The architecture is a form of Memory Network (Weston et al., 2015) but unlike the model in that work, it is trained end-to-end, and hence requires significantly less supervision during training, making it more generally applicable in realistic settings. It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results."
"Spectral Representations for Convolutional Neural Networks. Discrete Fourier transforms provide a significant speedup in the computation of convolutions in deep learning. In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).We employ spectral representations to introduce a number of innovations to CNN design. First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality reduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This approach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other pooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output dimensionality.  This representation also enables a new form of stochastic regularization by randomized modification of resolution.  We show that these methods achieve competitive results on classification and approximation tasks, without using any dropout or max-pooling.  Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of complex-coefficient spectral parameterization of convolutional filters. While this leaves the underlying model unchanged, it results in a representation that greatly facilitates optimization. We observe on a variety of popular CNN configurations that this leads to significantly faster convergence during training."
"Online Gradient Boosting. We extend the theory of boosting for regression problems to the online learning setting. Generalizing from the batch setting for boosting, the notion of a weak learning algorithm is modeled as an online learning algorithm with linear loss functions that competes with a base class of regression functions, while a strong learning algorithm is an online learning algorithm with smooth convex loss functions that competes with a larger class of regression functions. Our main result is an online gradient boosting algorithm which converts a weak online learning algorithm into a strong one where the larger class of functions is the linear span of the base class. We also give a simpler boosting algorithm that converts a weak online learning algorithm into a strong one where the larger class of functions is the convex hull of the base class, and prove its optimality."
"Deep Temporal Sigmoid Belief Networks for Sequence Modeling. Deep dynamic generative models are developed to learn sequential dependencies in time-series data. The multi-layered model is designed by constructing a hierarchy of temporal sigmoid belief networks (TSBNs), defined as a sequential stack of sigmoid belief networks (SBNs). Each SBN has a contextual hidden state, inherited from the previous SBNs in the sequence, and is used to regulate its hidden bias. Scalable learning and inference algorithms are derived by introducing a recognition model that yields fast sampling from the variational posterior. This recognition model is trained jointly with the generative model, by maximizing its variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Experimental results on bouncing balls, polyphonic music, motion capture, and text streams show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and has the capacity to synthesize various sequences."
"Recognizing retinal ganglion cells in the dark. Many neural circuits are composed of numerous distinct cell types that perform different operations on their inputs, and send their outputs to distinct targets.  Therefore, a key step in understanding neural systems is to reliably distinguish  cell types.  An important example is the retina, for which present-day techniques for identifying cell types are accurate, but very labor-intensive.  Here, we develop automated classifiers for functional identification of retinal ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina, based solely on recorded voltage patterns on a large scale array.  We use per-cell classifiers based on features extracted from electrophysiological images (spatiotemporal voltage waveforms) and interspike intervals (autocorrelations). These classifiers achieve high performance in distinguishing between the major ganglion cell classes of the primate retina, but fail in achieving the same accuracy in predicting cell polarities (ON vs. OFF).  We then show how to use indicators of functional coupling within populations of ganglion cells (cross-correlation) to infer cell polarities with a matrix completion algorithm.  This can result in accurate, fully automated methods for cell type classification."
"A Theory of Decision Making Under Dynamic Context. The dynamics of simple decisions are well understood and modeled as a class of random walk models (e.g. Laming, 1968; Ratcliff, 1978; Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993; Usher and McClelland, 2001; Bogacz et al., 2006). However, most real-life decisions include a rich and dynamically-changing influence of additional information we call context. In this work, we describe a computational theory of decision making under dynamically shifting context. We show how the model generalizes the dominant existing model of fixed-context decision making (Ratcliff, 1978) and can be built up from a weighted combination of fixed-context decisions evolving simultaneously. We also show how the model generalizes re- cent work on the control of attention in the Flanker task (Yu et al., 2009). Finally, we show how the model recovers qualitative data patterns in another task of longstanding psychological interest, the AX Continuous Performance Test (Servan-Schreiber et al., 1996), using the same model parameters."
"A Gaussian Process Model of Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions. We propose a method for combining two sources of astronomical data, spectroscopy and photometry, that carry information about sources of light (e.g., stars, galaxies, and quasars) at extremely different spectral resolutions.  Our model treats the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radiation from a source as a latent variable that jointly explains both photometric and spectroscopic observations.  We place a flexible, nonparametric prior over the SED of a light source that admits a physically interpretable decomposition, and allows us to tractably perform inference.  We use our model to predict the distribution of the redshift of a quasar from five-band (low spectral resolution) photometric data, the so called ``photo-z'' problem. Our method shows that tools from machine learning and Bayesian statistics allow us to leverage multiple resolutions of information to make accurate predictions with well-characterized uncertainties."
"Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems. Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complexprediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think ofthese quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering frameworkof technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenancecosts in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors toaccount for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement,hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configurationissues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns."
"Local Causal Discovery of Direct Causes and Effects. We focus on the discovery and identification of direct causes and effects of a target variable in a causal network. State-of-the-art algorithms generally need to find the global causal structures in the form of complete partial directed acyclic graphs in order to identify the direct causes and effects of a target variable. While these algorithms are effective, it is often unnecessary and wasteful to find the global structures when we are only interested in one target variable (such as class labels). We propose a new local causal discovery algorithm, called Causal Markov Blanket (CMB), to identify the direct causes and effects of a target variable based on Markov Blanket Discovery. CMB is designed to conduct causal discovery among multiple variables, but focuses only on finding causal relationships between a specific target variable and other variables. Under standard assumptions, we show both theoretically and experimentally that the proposed local causal discovery algorithm can obtain the comparable identification accuracy as global methods but significantly improve their efficiency, often by more than one order of magnitude."
"High Dimensional EM Algorithm: Statistical Optimization and Asymptotic Normality. We provide a general theory of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for inferring high dimensional latent variable models.   In particular, we make two contributions: (i) For parameter estimation, we propose a novel high dimensional EM algorithm which naturally incorporates sparsity structure into parameter estimation.  With an appropriate initialization, this algorithm converges at a geometric rate and attains an estimator with the (near-)optimal statistical rate of convergence.  (ii) Based on the obtained estimator, we propose a new inferential procedure for testing hypotheses for low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters.  For a broad family of statistical models,  our framework establishes the first computationally feasible approach for optimal estimation and asymptotic inference in high dimensions."
"Revenue Optimization against Strategic Buyers. We present a revenue optimization algorithm for posted-price auctions when facing a buyer with random valuations who seeks to optimize his $\gamma$-discounted surplus. To analyze this problem, we introduce the notion of  epsilon-strategic buyer, a more natural notion of strategic behavior than what has been used in the past.  We improve upon the previous state-of-the-art and achieve an optimal regret bound in  $O\Big( \log T + \frac{1}{\log(1/\gamma)} \Big)$ when the seller can offer prices from a finite set $\cP$ and provide a regret bound in  $\widetilde O \Big(\sqrt{T} + \frac{T^{1/4}}{\log(1/\gamma)} \Big)$ when the buyer is offered prices from the interval $[0, 1]$."
"Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphics Network. This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN), a model that aims to learn an interpretable representation of images, disentangled with respect to three-dimensional scene structure and viewing transformations such as depth rotations and lighting variations. The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose a training procedure to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to represent a specific transformation (e.g. pose or light). Given a single input image, our model can generate new images of the same object with variations in pose and lighting. We present qualitative and quantitative tests of the model's efficacy at learning a 3D rendering engine for varied object classes including faces and chairs."
"Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition. Motivated by the problem of robust factorization of a low-rank tensor, we study the question of sparse and low-rank tensor decomposition. We present an efficient computational algorithm that modifies Leurgans' algoirthm for tensor factorization. Our method relies on a reduction of the problem to sparse and low-rank matrix decomposition via the notion of tensor contraction. We use well-understood convex techniques for solving the reduced matrix sub-problem which then allows us to perform the full decomposition of the tensor. We delineate situations where the problem is recoverable and provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm. We validate our algorithm with numerical experiments."
"Minimax Time Series Prediction. We consider an adversarial formulation of the problem ofpredicting a time series with square loss.  The aim is to predictan arbitrary sequence of vectors almost as well as the bestsmooth comparator sequence in retrospect.  Our approach allowsnatural measures of smoothness such as the squared norm ofincrements. More generally, we consider a linear time seriesmodel and penalize the comparator sequence through the energy ofthe implied driving noise terms.  We derive the minimax strategyfor all problems of this type and show that it can be implementedefficiently.  The optimal predictions are linear in the previousobservations.  We obtain an explicit expression for the regret interms of the parameters defining the problem.  For typical,simple definitions of smoothness, the computation of the optimalpredictions involves only sparse matrices.  In the case ofnorm-constrained data, where the smoothness is defined in termsof the squared norm of the comparator's increments, we show thatthe regret grows as $T/\sqrt{\lambda_T}$, where $T$ is the lengthof the game and $\lambda_T$ is an increasing limit on comparatorsmoothness."
Differentially Private Learning of Structured Discrete Distributions. We investigate the problem of learning an unknown probability distribution over a discrete population from random samples. Our goal is to design efficient algorithms that simultaneously achieve low error in total variation norm while guaranteeing Differential Privacy to the individuals of the population.We describe a general approach that yields near sample-optimal and computationally efficient differentially private estimators for a wide range of well-studied and natural distribution families. Our theoretical results show that for a wide variety of structured distributions there exist private estimation algorithms that are nearly as efficient - both in terms of sample size and running time - as their non-private counterparts. We complement our theoretical guarantees with an experimental evaluation. Our experiments illustrate the speed and accuracy of our private estimators on both synthetic mixture models and a large public data set.
"Sample Complexity of Learning Mahalanobis Distance Metrics. Metric learning seeks a transformation of the feature space that enhances prediction quality for a given task. In this work we provide PAC-style sample complexity rates for supervised metric learning. We give matching lower- and upper-bounds showing that sample complexity scales with the representation dimension when no assumptions are made about the underlying data distribution. In addition, by leveraging the structure of the data distribution, we provide rates fine-tuned to a specific notion of the intrinsic complexity of a given dataset, allowing us to relax the dependence on representation dimension. We show both theoretically and empirically that augmenting the metric learning optimization criterion with a simple norm-based regularization is important and can help adapt to a dataset’s intrinsic complexity yielding better generalization, thus partly explaining the empirical success of similar regularizations reported in previous works."
"Learning Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Models. Despite their success, convolutional neural networks are computationally expensive because they must examine all image locations. Stochastic attention-based models have been shown to improve computational efficiency at test time, but they remain difficult to train because of intractable posterior inference and high variance in the stochastic gradient estimates. Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients. We show that our method can greatly speed up the training time for stochastic attention networks in the domains of image classification and caption generation."
"Robust Gaussian Graphical Modeling with the Trimmed Graphical Lasso. Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for studying network structures. However, many modern applications such as gene network discovery and social interactions analysis often involve high-dimensional noisy data with outliers or heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we propose the Trimmed Graphical Lasso for robust estimation of sparse GGMs.  Our method guards against outliers by an implicit trimming mechanism akin to the popular Least Trimmed Squares method used for linear regression. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of our estimator in the high-dimensional setting. In contrast, existing approaches for robust sparse GGMs estimation lack statistical guarantees. Our theoretical results are complemented by experiments on simulated and real gene expression data which further demonstrate the value of our approach."
"Testing Closeness With Unequal Sized Samples. We consider the problem of testing whether two unequal-sized samples were drawn from identical distributions, versus distributions that differ significantly.  Specifically, given a target error parameter $\eps > 0$,  $m_1$ independent draws from an unknown distribution $p$ with discrete support, and $m_2$ draws from an unknown distribution $q$ of discrete support, we describe a test for distinguishing the case that $p=q$ from the case that $||p-q||_1 \geq \eps$. If $p$ and $q$ are supported on at most $n$ elements, then our test is successful with high probability provided $m_1\geq n^{2/3}/\varepsilon^{4/3}$ and $m_2 = \Omega\left(\max\{\frac{n}{\sqrt m_1\varepsilon^2}, \frac{\sqrt n}{\varepsilon^2}\}\right).$ We show that this tradeoff is information theoretically optimal throughout this range, in the dependencies on all parameters, $n,m_1,$ and $\eps$, to constant factors. As a consequence, we obtain an algorithm for estimating the mixing time of a Markov chain on $n$ states up to a $\log n$ factor that uses $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2} \tau_{mix})$ queries to a ``next node'' oracle. The core of our testing algorithm is a relatively simple statistic that seems to perform well in practice, both on synthetic data and on natural language data.  We believe that this statistic might prove to be a useful primitive within larger machine learning and natural language processing systems."
"Estimating Jaccard Index with Missing Observations: A Matrix Calibration Approach. The Jaccard index is a standard statistics for comparing the pairwise similarity between data samples. This paper investigates the problem of estimating a Jaccard index matrix when there are missing observations in data samples. Starting from a Jaccard index matrix approximated from the incomplete data, our method calibrates the matrix to meet the requirement of positive semi-definiteness and other constraints, through a simple alternating projection algorithm. Compared with conventional approaches that estimate the similarity matrix based on the imputed data, our method has a strong advantage in that the calibrated matrix is guaranteed to be closer to the unknown ground truth in the Frobenius norm than the un-calibrated matrix (except in special cases they are identical). We carried out a series of empirical experiments and the results confirmed our theoretical justification. The evaluation also reported significantly improved results in real learning tasks on benchmarked datasets."
"Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is a popular class of methods for sampling from an intractable target distribution using a sequence of simpler intermediate distributions. Like other importance sampling-based methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution. This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible, applicable to any parameterized proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich parameterizations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC significantly improves inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a latent variable recurrent neural network (LV-RNN) achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference."
"Local Expectation Gradients for Black Box Variational Inference. We introduce local expectation gradients which is a general purpose stochastic variational inference algorithm for constructing stochastic gradients by sampling from the variational distribution. This algorithm divides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple variational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task explores intelligently the most relevant part of the variational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation over the single random variable that most correlates with the variational parameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low variance. Our method works efficiently for both continuous and discrete random variables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities with Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, can be trivially parallelized."
"On Variance Reduction in Stochastic Gradient Descent and its Asynchronous Variants. We study optimization algorithms based on variance reduction for stochastic gradientdescent (SGD). Remarkable recent progress has been made in this directionthrough development of algorithms like SAG, SVRG, SAGA. These algorithmshave been shown to outperform SGD, both theoretically and empirically. However,asynchronous versions of these algorithms—a crucial requirement for modernlarge-scale applications—have not been studied. We bridge this gap by presentinga unifying framework that captures many variance reduction techniques.Subsequently, we propose an asynchronous algorithm grounded in our framework,with fast convergence rates. An important consequence of our general approachis that it yields asynchronous versions of variance reduction algorithms such asSVRG, SAGA as a byproduct. Our method achieves near linear speedup in sparsesettings common to machine learning. We demonstrate the empirical performanceof our method through a concrete realization of asynchronous SVRG."
"NEXT: A System for Real-World Development, Evaluation, and Application of Active Learning. Active learning methods automatically adapt data collection by selecting the most informative samples in order to accelerate machine learning. Because of this, real-world testing and comparing active learning algorithms requires collecting new datasets (adaptively), rather than simply applying algorithms to benchmark datasets, as is the norm in (passive) machine learning research. To facilitate the development, testing and deployment of active learning for real applications, we have built an open-source software system for large-scale active learning research and experimentation.  The system, called NEXT,  provides a unique platform for real-world, reproducible active learning research. This paper details the challenges of building the system and demonstrates its capabilities with several experiments.  The results show how experimentation can help expose strengths and weaknesses of active learning algorithms, in sometimes unexpected and enlightening ways."
"Super-Resolution Off the Grid. Super-resolution is the problem of recovering a superposition of point sources using bandlimited measurements, which may be corrupted with noise. This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some \emph{cutoff frequency}); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly.  Suppose we have $k$ point sources in $d$ dimensions, where the points are separated by at least $\Delta$ from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees:1. The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by $O(1/\Delta)$ (up to log factors). Previous algorithms require a \emph{cutoff frequency}  which may be as large as  $\Omega(\sqrt{d}/\Delta)$.2. The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points $k$ and the dimension $d$, with \emph{no} dependence on the separation $\Delta$. In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse polynomially  on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for both of these quantities.Our estimation procedure itself is simple: we take random bandlimited measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the hyper-grid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on concentration bounds of sampling and singular value decomposition)."
"Taming the Wild: A Unified Analysis of Hogwild-Style Algorithms. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a ubiquitous algorithm for a variety of machine learning problems. Researchers and industry have developed several techniques to optimize SGD's runtime performance, including asynchronous execution and reduced precision. Our main result is a martingale-based analysis that enables us to capture the rich noise models that may arise from such techniques. Specifically, we useour new analysis in three ways: (1) we derive convergence rates for the convex case (Hogwild) with relaxed assumptions on the sparsity of the problem; (2) we analyze asynchronous SGD algorithms for non-convex matrix problems including matrix completion; and (3) we design and analyze an asynchronous SGD algorithm, called Buckwild, that uses lower-precision arithmetic. We show experimentally that our algorithms run efficiently for a variety of problems on modern hardware."
"The Return of the Gating Network: Combining Generative Models and Discriminative Training in Natural Image Priors. In recent years, approaches based on machine learning have achieved state-of-the-art performance on image restoration problems. Successful approaches include both generative models of natural images as well as discriminative training of deep neural networks. Discriminative training of feed forward architectures allows explicit control over the computational cost of performing restoration and therefore often leads to better performance at the same cost at run time.  In contrast, generative models have the advantage that they can be trained once and then adapted to any image restoration task by a simple use of Bayes' rule. In this paper we show how to combine the strengths of both approaches by training a discriminative, feed-forward architecture to predict the state of latent variables in a generative model of natural images. We apply this idea to the very successful Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) of natural images. We show that it is possible to achieve comparable performance as the original GMM but with two orders of magnitude improvement in run time while maintaining the advantage of generative models."
"Pointer Networks. We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that arediscrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence.Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines,because the number of target classes in eachstep of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable.Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorialoptimization problems belong to this class.  Our model solvesthe problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposedmechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attentionattempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of anencoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention asa pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net).We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to threechallenging geometric problems -- finding planar convex hulls, computingDelaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem-- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve oversequence-to-sequence with input attention, butalso allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries.We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengthsthey were trained on. We hope our results on these taskswill encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discreteproblems."
"Associative Memory via a Sparse Recovery Model. An associative memory is a structure learned from a dataset $\mathcal{M}$ of vectors (signals) in a way such that, given a noisy version of one of the vectors as input, the nearest valid  vector from $\mathcal{M}$ (nearest neighbor) is provided as output, preferably via a fast iterative algorithm. Traditionally, binary (or $q$-ary) Hopfield neural networks are used to  model the above structure. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a model of associative memory based on sparse recovery of signals. Our basic premise is simple. For a dataset, we learn a set of linear constraints that every vector in the  dataset must satisfy. Provided these linear constraints possess  some special properties, it is possible to cast the task of finding nearest neighbor as a sparse recovery problem. Assuming  generic random models for the dataset, we show that it is possible to store super-polynomial or exponential number of $n$-length vectors in a neural network of size $O(n)$. Furthermore, given a noisy version of one of the  stored vectors corrupted in near-linear number of coordinates, the vector can be correctly recalled using a neurally feasible algorithm."
"Robust Spectral Inference for Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization. Spectral inference provides fast algorithms and provable optimality for latent topic analysis. But for real data these algorithms require additional ad-hoc heuristics, and even then often produce unusable results. We explain this poor performance by casting the problem of topic inference in the framework of Joint Stochastic Matrix Factorization (JSMF) and showing that previous methods violate the theoretical conditions necessary for a good solution to exist. We then propose a novel rectification method that learns high quality topics and their interactions even on small, noisy data. This method achieves results comparable to probabilistic techniques in several domains while maintaining scalability and provable optimality."
"Fast, Provable Algorithms for Isotonic Regression in all L_p-norms. Given a directed acyclic graph $G,$ and a set of values $y$ on the vertices, the Isotonic Regression of $y$ is a vector $x$ that respects the partial order described by $G,$ and minimizes $\|x-y\|,$ for a specified norm.  This paper gives improved algorithms for computing the Isotonic Regression for all weighted $\ell_{p}$-norms with rigorous performance guarantees. Our algorithms are quite practical, and their variants can be implemented to run fast in practice."
"Adversarial Prediction Games for Multivariate Losses. Multivariate loss functions are used to assess performance in many modern prediction tasks, including information retrieval and ranking applications. Convex approximations are typically optimized in their place to avoid NP-hard empirical risk minimization problems. We propose to approximate the training data instead of the loss function by posing multivariate prediction as an adversarial game between a loss-minimizing prediction player and a loss-maximizing evaluation player constrained to match specified properties of training data. This avoids the non-convexity of empirical risk minimization, but game sizes are exponential in the number of predicted variables. We overcome this intractability using the double oracle constraint generation method. We demonstrate the efficiency and predictive performance of our approach on tasks evaluated using the precision at k, the F-score and the discounted cumulative gain."
"Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient for Nonconvex Optimization. The asynchronous parallel implementations of stochastic gradient (SG) have been broadly used in solving deep neural network and received many successes in practice recently. However, existing theories cannot explain their convergence and speedup properties, mainly due to the nonconvexity of most deep learning formulations and the asynchronous parallel mechanism. To fill the gaps in theory and provide theoretical supports, this paper studies two asynchronous parallel implementations of SG: one is on the computer network and the other is on the shared memory system. We establish an ergodic convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{K})$ for both algorithms and prove that the linear speedup is achievable if the number of workers is bounded by $\sqrt{K}$ ($K$ is the total number of iterations). Our results generalize and improve existing analysis for convex minimization."
"Embed to Control: A Locally Linear Latent Dynamics Model for Control from Raw Images. We introduce Embed to Control (E2C), a method for model learning and control of non-linear dynamical systems from raw pixel images. E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems."
"Efficient and Parsimonious Agnostic Active Learning. We develop a new active learning algorithm for the streaming settingsatisfying three important properties: 1) It provably works for anyclassifier representation and classification problem including thosewith severe noise. 2) It is efficiently implementable with an ERMoracle.  3) It is more aggressive than all previous approachessatisfying 1 and 2. To do this, we create an algorithm based on a newlydefined optimization problem and analyze it. We also conduct the firstexperimental analysis of all efficient agnostic active learningalgorithms, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in differentsettings."
"Softstar: Heuristic-Guided Probabilistic Inference. Recent machine learning methods for sequential behavior prediction estimate the motives of behavior rather than the behavior itself. This higher-level abstraction improves generalization in different prediction settings, but computing predictions often becomes intractable in large decision spaces.  We propose the Softstar algorithm, a softened heuristic-guided search technique for the maximum entropy inverse optimal control model of sequential behavior.  This approach supports probabilistic search with bounded approximation error at a significantly reduced computational cost when compared to sampling based methods.  We present the algorithm, analyze approximation guarantees, and compare performance with simulation-based inference on two distinct complex decision tasks."
"Grammar as a Foreign Language. Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in naturallanguage processing which has been the subject of intensive researchand engineering for decades.  As a result, the most accurate parsersare domain specific, complex, and inefficient.  In this paper we showthat the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence modelachieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntacticconstituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic corpusthat was annotated using existing parsers.  It also matches theperformance of standard parsers when trained on a smallhuman-annotated dataset, which shows that this model is highlydata-efficient, in contrast to sequence-to-sequence models without theattention mechanism.  Our parser is also fast, processing over ahundred sentences per second with an unoptimized CPU implementation."
"Regularization-Free Estimation in Trace Regression with Symmetric Positive Semidefinite Matrices. Trace regression models have received considerable attention in the context of matrix completion, quantum state tomography, and compressed sensing. Estimation of the underlying matrix from regularization-based approaches promoting low-rankedness, notably nuclear norm regularization, have enjoyed great popularity. In this paper, we argue that such regularization may no longer be necessary if the underlying matrix is symmetric positive semidefinite (spd) and the design satisfies certain conditions. In this situation, simple least squares estimation subject to an spd constraint may perform as well as regularization-based approaches with a proper choice of  regularization parameter, which entails knowledge of the noise level and/or tuning. By contrast, constrained least squaresestimation comes without any tuning parameter and may hence be preferred due to its simplicity."
"Winner-Take-All Autoencoders. In this paper, we propose a winner-take-all method for learning hierarchical sparse representations in an unsupervised fashion. We first introduce fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoders which use mini-batch statistics to directly enforce a lifetime sparsity in the activations of the hidden units. We then propose the convolutional winner-take-all autoencoder which combines the benefits of convolutional architectures and autoencoders for learning shift-invariant sparse representations. We describe a way to train convolutional autoencoders layer by layer, where in addition to lifetime sparsity, a spatial sparsity within each feature map is achieved using winner-take-all activation functions. We will show that winner-take-all autoencoders can be used to to learn deep sparse representations from the MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets, and achieve competitive classification performance."
"Deep Poisson Factor Modeling. We propose a new deep architecture for topic modeling, based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. The model is composed of a Poisson distribution to model observed vectors of counts, as well as a deep hierarchy of hidden binary units. Rather than using logistic functions to characterize the probability that a latent binary unit is on, we employ a Bernoulli-Poisson link, which allows PFA modules to be used repeatedly in the deep architecture. We also describe an approach to build discriminative topic models, by adapting PFA modules. We derive efficient inference via MCMC and stochastic variational methods, that scale with the number of non-zeros in the data and binary units, yielding significant efficiency, relative to models based on logistic links. Experiments on several corpora demonstrate the advantages of our model when compared to related deep models."
"Bayesian Optimization with Exponential Convergence. This paper presents a Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence without the need of auxiliary optimization and without the delta-cover sampling. Most Bayesian optimization methods require auxiliary optimization: an additional non-convex global optimization problem, which can be time-consuming and hard to implement in practice. Also, the existing Bayesian optimization method with exponential convergence requires access to the delta-cover sampling, which was considered to be impractical. Our approach eliminates both requirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate."
"Sample Complexity of Episodic Fixed-Horizon Reinforcement Learning. Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds.  However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound of order O(|S|²|A|H² log(1/δ)/ɛ²)  and a lower PAC bound Ω(|S||A|H² log(1/(δ+c))/ɛ²) (ignoring log-terms) that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of states |S|.  The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein's inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least H³."
"Learning with Relaxed Supervision. For weakly-supervised problems with deterministic constraints between the latent variables and observed output, learning necessitates performing inference over latent variables conditioned on the output, which can be intractable no matter how simple the model family is. Even finding a single latent variable setting that satisfies the constraints could be difficult; for instance, the observed output may be the result of a latent database query or graphics program which must be inferred. Here, the difficulty lies in not the model but the supervision, and poor approximations at this stage could lead to following the wrong learning signal entirely. In this paper, we develop a rigorous approach to relaxing the supervision, which yields asymptotically consistent parameter estimates despite altering the supervision. Our approach parameterizes a family of increasingly accurate relaxations, and jointly optimizes both the model and relaxation parameters, while formulating constraints between these parameters to ensure efficient inference. These efficiency constraints allow us to learn in otherwise intractable settings, while asymptotic consistency ensures that we always follow a valid learning signal."
"Subsampled Power Iteration: a Unified Algorithm for Block Models and Planted CSP's. We present an algorithm for recovering planted solutions in two well-known models, the stochastic block model and planted constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), via a common generalization in terms of random bipartite graphs. Our algorithm matches up to a constant factor the best-known bounds  for the number of edges (or constraints) needed for perfect recovery and its running time is linear in the number of edges used. The time complexity is significantly better than both spectral and SDP-based approaches.The main contribution of the algorithm is in the case of unequal sizes in the bipartition that arises in our reduction from the planted CSP.  Here our algorithm succeeds at a significantly lower density than the spectral approaches, surpassing a barrier based on the spectral norm of a random matrix.Other significant features of the algorithm and analysis include (i) the critical use of power iteration with subsampling, which might be of independent interest; its analysis requires keeping track of multiple norms of an evolving solution (ii) the algorithm can be implemented statistically, i.e., with very limited access to the input distribution (iii) the algorithm is extremely simple to implement and runs in linear time, and thus is practical even for very large instances."
"Accelerated Mirror Descent in Continuous and Discrete Time. We study accelerated mirror descent dynamics in continuous and discrete time. Combining the original continuous-time motivation of mirror descent with a recent ODE interpretation of Nesterov's accelerated method, we propose a family of continuous-time descent dynamics for convex functions with Lipschitz gradients, such that the solution trajectories are guaranteed to converge to the optimum at a $O(1/t^2)$ rate. We then show that a large family of first-order accelerated methods can be obtained as a discretization of the ODE, and these methods converge at a $O(1/k^2)$ rate. This connection between accelerated mirror descent and the ODE provides an intuitive approach to the design and analysis of accelerated first-order algorithms."
"The Human Kernel. Bayesian nonparametric models, such as Gaussian processes, provide a compelling framework for automatic statistical modelling: these models have a high degree of flexibility, and automatically calibrated complexity.  However, automating human expertise remains elusive; for example, Gaussian processes with standard kernels struggle on function extrapolation problems that are trivial for human learners. In this paper, we create function extrapolation problems and acquire human responses, and then design a kernel learning framework to reverse engineer the inductive biases of human learners across a set of behavioral experiments. We use the learned kernels to gain psychological insights and to extrapolate in human-like ways that go beyond traditional stationary and polynomial kernels.  Finally, we investigate Occam's razor in human and Gaussian process based function learning."
"Action-Conditional Video Prediction using Deep Networks in Atari Games. Motivated by vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in particular Atari games from the recent benchmark Aracade Learning Environment (ALE), we consider spatio-temporal prediction problems where future (image-)frames are dependent on control variables or actions as well as previous frames. While not composed of natural scenes, frames in Atari games are high-dimensional in size, can involve tens of objects with one or more objects being controlled by the actions directly and many other objects being influenced indirectly, can involve entry and departure of objects, and can involve deep partial observability. We propose and evaluate two deep neural network architectures that consist of encoding, action-conditional transformation, and decoding layers based on convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Experimental results show that the proposed architectures are able to generate visually-realistic frames that are also useful for control over approximately 100-step action-conditional futures in some games. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to make and evaluate long-term predictions on high-dimensional video conditioned by control inputs."
"A Pseudo-Euclidean Iteration for Optimal Recovery in Noisy ICA. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular model for blind signal separation. The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals are linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm, PEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for ICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to use a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite “inner product”) space. The use of this indefinite “inner product” resolves technical issues common to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm which is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing.Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for optimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct approach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for signal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA literature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction problem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact that SINR itself cannot be computed from data. That allows us to obtain a practical and provably SINR-optimal recovery method for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise."
"Distributed Submodular Cover: Succinctly Summarizing Massive Data. How can one find a subset, ideally as small as possible, that well represents a massive dataset? I.e., its corresponding utility, measured according to a suitable utility function, should be comparable to that of the whole dataset. In this paper, we formalize this challenge as a submodular cover problem. Here, the utility is assumed to exhibit submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition preva- lent in many data summarization applications. The classical greedy algorithm is known to provide solutions with logarithmic approximation guarantees compared to the optimum solution. However, this sequential, centralized approach is imprac- tical for truly large-scale problems. In this work, we develop the first distributed algorithm – DISCOVER – for submodular set cover that is easily implementable using MapReduce-style computations. We theoretically analyze our approach, and present approximation guarantees for the solutions returned by DISCOVER. We also study a natural trade-off between the communication cost and the num- ber of rounds required to obtain such a solution. In our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several applications, includ- ing active set selection, exemplar based clustering, and vertex cover on tens of millions of data points using Spark."
"Community Detection via Measure Space Embedding. We present a new algorithm for community detection. The algorithm uses random walks to embed the graph in a space of measures, after which a modification of $k$-means in that space is applied. The algorithm is therefore fast and easily parallelizable. We evaluate the algorithm on standard random graph benchmarks, including some overlapping community benchmarks,  and find its performance to be better or at least as good as previously known  algorithms. We also prove a linear time (in number of edges) guarantee for the algorithm on a $p,q$-stochastic block model with  where $p \geq c\cdot N^{-\half +  \epsilon}$ and $p-q \geq c' \sqrt{p N^{-\half +  \epsilon} \log N}$."
"Basis refinement strategies for linear value function approximation in MDPs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing basis function construction for linear value function approximation in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We show that important existing methods, such as Krylov bases and Bellman-error-based methods are a special case of the general framework we develop. We provide a general algorithmic framework for computing basis function refinements which “respect” the dynamics of the environment, and we derive approximation error bounds that apply for any algorithm respecting this general framework. We also show how, using ideas related to bisimulation metrics, one can translate basis refinement into a process of finding “prototypes” that are diverse enough to represent the given MDP."
"Structured Estimation with Atomic Norms: General Bounds and Applications. For structured estimation problems with atomic norms, recent advances in the literature express sample complexity and estimation error bounds in terms of certain geometric measures, in particular Gaussian width of the unit norm ball, Gaussian width of a spherical cap induced by a tangent cone, and a restricted norm compatibility constant. However, given an atomic norm, bounding these geometric measures can be difficult. In this paper, we present general upper bounds for such geometric measures, which only require simple information of the atomic norm under consideration, and we establish tightness of these bounds by providing the corresponding lower bounds. We show applications of our analysis to certain atomic norms, especially k-support norm, for which existing result is incomplete."
"A Complete Recipe for Stochastic Gradient MCMC. Many recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers leverage continuous dynamics to define a transition kernel that efficiently explores a target distribution. In tandem, a focus has been on devising scalable variants that subsample the data and use stochastic gradients in place of full-data gradients in the dynamic simulations. However, such stochastic gradient MCMC samplers have lagged behind their full-data counterparts in terms of the complexity of dynamics considered since proving convergence in the presence of the stochastic gradient noise is non-trivial.  Even with simple dynamics, significant physical intuition is often required to modify the dynamical system to account for the stochastic gradient noise.  In this paper, we provide a general recipe for constructing MCMC samplers--including stochastic gradient versions--based on continuous Markov processes specified via two matrices.  We constructively prove that the framework is complete. That is, any continuous Markov process that provides samples from the target distribution can be written in our framework.  We show how previous continuous-dynamic samplers can be trivially reinvented in our framework, avoiding the complicated sampler-specific proofs. We likewise use our recipe to straightforwardly propose a new state-adaptive sampler: stochastic gradient Riemann Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGRHMC).  Our experiments on simulated data and a streaming Wikipedia analysis demonstrate that the proposed SGRHMC sampler inherits the benefits of Riemann HMC, with the scalability of stochastic gradient methods."
"Bandit Smooth Convex Optimization: Improving the Bias-Variance Tradeoff. Bandit convex optimization is one of the fundamental problems in the field of online learning. The best algorithm for the general bandit convex optimization problem guarantees a regret of $\widetilde{O}(T^{5/6})$, while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(T^{1/2})$. Many attemptshave been made to bridge the huge gap between these bounds. A particularly interesting special case of this problem assumes that the loss functions are smooth. In this case, the best known algorithm guarantees a regret of $\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$. We present an efficient algorithm for the banditsmooth convex optimization problem that guarantees a regret of $\widetilde{O}(T^{5/8})$. Our result rules out an $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound and takes a significant step towards the resolution of this open problem."
"Online Prediction at the Limit of Zero Temperature. We design an online algorithm to classify the vertices of a graph.   Underpinning the algorithm is the probability distribution of an  Ising model isomorphic to the graph.   Each classification is based on predicting the label with maximum marginal probability in the limit of zero-temperature with respect to the labels and vertices seen so far.  Computing these classifications is unfortunately based on a $\#P$-complete problem.  This motivates us to develop an algorithm for which we give a sequential guarantee in the online mistake bound framework.    Our algorithm is optimal when the graph is a tree matching the prior results in [1].For a general graph, the algorithm exploits the additional connectivity over a tree to provide a per-cluster bound. The algorithm is efficient as the cumulative time to sequentially predict all of the vertices of the graph is quadratic in the size of the graph."
"Learning Continuous Control Policies by Stochastic Value Gradients. We present a unified framework for learning continuous control policies usingbackpropagation. It supports stochastic control by treating stochasticity in theBellman equation as a deterministic function of exogenous noise. The productis a spectrum of general policy gradient algorithms that range from model-freemethods with value functions to model-based methods without value functions.We use learned models but only require observations from the environment insteadof observations from model-predicted trajectories, minimizing the impactof compounded model errors. We apply these algorithms first to a toy stochasticcontrol problem and then to several physics-based control problems in simulation.One of these variants, SVG(1), shows the effectiveness of learning models, valuefunctions, and policies simultaneously in continuous domains."
"Exploring Models and Data for Image Question Answering. This work aims to address the problem of image-based question-answering (QA) with new models and datasets. In our work, we propose to use neural networks and visual semantic embeddings, without intermediate stages such as object detection and image segmentation, to predict answers to simple questions about images. Our model performs 1.8 times better than the only published results on an existing image QA dataset. We also present a question generation algorithm that converts image descriptions, which are widely available, into QA form. We used this algorithm to produce an order-of-magnitude larger dataset, with more evenly distributed answers. A suite of baseline results on this new dataset are also presented."
"Efficient and Robust Automated Machine Learning. The success of machine learning in a broad range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. In this work we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on scikit-learn (using 15 classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML methods by automatically taking into account past performance on similar datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models evaluated during the optimization. Our system won the first phase of the ongoing ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due to each of our contributions and derive insights into the effectiveness of the individual components of auto-sklearn."
"Preconditioned Spectral Descent for Deep Learning. Deep learning presents notorious computational challenges. These challenges include, but are not limited to, the non-convexity of learning objectives and estimating the quantities needed for optimization algorithms, such as gradients. While we do not address the non-convexity, we present an optimization solution that ex- ploits the so far unused “geometry” in the objective function in order to best make use of the estimated gradients. Previous work attempted similar goals with preconditioned methods in the Euclidean space, such as L-BFGS, RMSprop, and ADA-grad. In stark contrast, our approach combines a non-Euclidean gradient method with preconditioning. We provide evidence that this combination more accurately captures the geometry of the objective function compared to prior work. We theoretically formalize our arguments and derive novel preconditioned non-Euclidean algorithms. The results are promising in both computational time and quality when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets."
"A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential Data. In this paper, we explore the inclusion of latent random variables into the hidden state of a recurrent neural network (RNN) by combining the elements of the variational autoencoder. We argue that through the use of high-level latent random variables, the variational RNN (VRNN) can model the kind of variability observed in highly structured sequential data such as natural speech. We empirically evaluate the proposed model against other related sequential models on four speech datasets and one handwriting dataset. Our results show the important roles that latent random variables can play in the RNN dynamics."
"Fast Convergence of Regularized Learning in Games. We show that natural classes of regularized learning algorithms with a form of recency bias achieve faster convergence rates to approximate efficiency and to coarse correlated equilibria in multiplayer normal form games. When each player in a game uses an algorithm from our class, their individual regret decays at $O(T^{-3/4})$, while the sum of utilities converges to an approximate optimum at $O(T^{-1})$--an improvement upon the worst case $O(T^{-1/2})$ rates. We show a black-box reduction for any algorithm in the class to achieve $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$ rates against an adversary, while maintaining the faster rates against algorithms in the class. Our results extend those of Rakhlin and Shridharan~\cite{Rakhlin2013} and Daskalakis et al.~\cite{Daskalakis2014}, who only analyzed two-player zero-sum games for specific algorithms."
"Parallel Multi-Dimensional LSTM, With Application to Fast Biomedical Volumetric Image Segmentation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be shifted across 2D images or 3D videos to segment them. They have a fixed input size and typically perceive only small local contexts of the pixels to be classified as foreground or background. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional Recurrent NNs (MD-RNNs) can perceive the entire spatio-temporal context of each pixel in a few sweeps through all pixels, especially when the RNN is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Despite these theoretical advantages, however, unlike CNNs, previous MD-LSTM variants were hard to parallelise on GPUs. Here we re-arrange the traditional cuboid order of computations in MD-LSTM in pyramidal fashion. The resulting PyraMiD-LSTM is easy to parallelise, especially for 3D data such as stacks of brain slice images. PyraMiD-LSTM achieved best known pixel-wise brain image segmentation results on MRBrainS13 (and competitive results on EM-ISBI12)."
"Reflection, Refraction, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a successful approach for sampling from continuous densities. However, it has difficulty simulating Hamiltonian dynamics with non-smooth functions, leading to poor performance. This paper is motivated by the behavior of Hamiltonian dynamics in physical systems like optics. We introduce a modification of the Leapfrog discretization of Hamiltonian dynamics on piecewise continuous energies, where intersections of the trajectory with discontinuities are detected, and the momentum is reflected or refracted to compensate for the change in energy. We prove that this method preserves the correct stationary distribution when boundaries are affine. Experiments show that by reducing the number of rejected samples, this method improves on traditional HMC."
"The Consistency of Common Neighbors for Link Prediction in Stochastic Blockmodels. Link prediction and clustering are key problems for network-structureddata. While spectral clustering has strong theoretical guaranteesunder the popular stochastic blockmodel formulation of networks, itcan be expensive for large graphs. On the other hand, the heuristic ofpredicting links to nodes that share the most common neighbors withthe query node is much fast, and works very well in practice. We showtheoretically that the common neighbors heuristic can extract clustersw.h.p. when the graph is dense enough, and can do so even in sparsergraphs with the addition of a ``cleaning'' step. Empirical results onsimulated and real-world data support our conclusions."
"Nearly Optimal Private LASSO. We present a nearly optimal differentially private version of the well known LASSO estimator. Our algorithm provides privacy protection with respect to each training data item. The excess risk of our algorithm, compared to the non-private version, is $\widetilde{O}(1/n^{2/3})$, assuming all the input data has bounded $\ell_\infty$ norm. This is the first differentially private algorithm that achieves such a bound without the polynomial dependence on $p$ under no addition assumption on the design matrix. In addition, we show that this error bound is nearly optimal amongst all differentially private algorithms."
"Convergence Analysis of Prediction Markets via Randomized Subspace Descent. Prediction markets are economic mechanisms for aggregating information about future events through sequential interactions with traders.  The pricing mechanisms in these markets are known to be related to optimization algorithms in machine learning and through these connections we have some understanding of how equilibrium market prices relate to the beliefs of the traders in a market.  However, little is known about rates and guarantees for the convergence of these sequential mechanisms, and two recent papers cite this as an important open question.In this paper we show how some previously studied prediction market trading models can be understood as a natural generalization of randomized coordinate descent which we call randomized subspace descent (RSD).  We establish convergence rates for RSD and leverage them to prove rates for the two prediction market models above, answering the open questions.  Our results extend beyond standard centralized markets to arbitrary trade networks."
"The Poisson Gamma Belief Network. To infer a multilayer representation of high-dimensional count vectors, we propose the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN) that factorizes each of its layers into the product of a connection weight matrix and the nonnegative real hidden units of the next layer. The PGBN's hidden layers are jointly trained with an upward-downward Gibbs sampler, each iteration of which upward samples Dirichlet distributed connection weight vectors starting from the first layer (bottom data layer), and then downward samples gamma distributed hidden units starting from the top hidden layer. The gamma-negative binomial process combined with a layer-wise training strategy allows the PGBN to infer the width of each layer given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. The PGBN with a single hidden layer reduces to Poisson factor analysis. Example results on text analysis illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the PGBN, whose hidden units are imposed with correlated gamma priors, can add more layers to increase its performance gains over Poisson factor analysis, given the same limit on the width of the first layer."
"Convergence rates of sub-sampled Newton methods. We consider the problem of minimizing a sum of $n$ functions via projected iterations onto a convex parameter set $\C \subset \reals^p$, where $n\gg p\gg 1$. In this regime, algorithms which utilize sub-sampling techniques are known to be effective.In this paper, we use sub-sampling techniques together with low-rank approximation to design a new randomized batch algorithm which possesses comparable convergence rate to Newton's method, yet has much smaller per-iteration cost. The proposed algorithm is robust in terms of starting point and step size, and enjoys a composite convergence rate, namely, quadratic convergence at start and linear convergence when the iterate is close to the minimizer. We develop its theoretical analysis which also allows us to select near-optimal algorithm parameters. Our theoretical results can be used to obtain convergence rates of previously proposed sub-sampling based algorithms as well. We demonstrate how our results apply to well-known machine learning problems.Lastly, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets under various scenarios."
"No-Regret Learning in Bayesian Games. Recent price-of-anarchy analyses of games of complete information suggest that coarse correlated equilibria, which characterize outcomes resulting from no-regret learning dynamics, have near-optimal welfare. This work provides two main technical results that lift this conclusion to games of incomplete information, a.k.a., Bayesian games. First, near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public.  Second, no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games. These results are enabled by interpretation of a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information."
"Statistical Topological Data Analysis - A Kernel Perspective. We consider the problem of statistical computations with persistence diagrams, a summary representation of topological features in data. These diagrams encode persistent homology, a widely used invariant in topological data analysis. While several avenues towards a statistical treatment of the diagrams have been explored recently, we follow an alternative route that is motivated by the success of methods based on the embedding of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. In fact, a positive definite kernel on persistence diagrams has recently been proposed, connecting persistent homology to popular kernel-based learning techniques such as support vector machines. However, important properties of that kernel which would enable a principled use in the context of probability measure embeddings remain to be explored. Our contribution is to close this gap by proving universality of a variant of the original kernel, and to demonstrate its effective use in two-sample hypothesis testing on synthetic as well as real-world data."
"Semi-supervised Sequence Learning. We present two approaches to use unlabeled data to improve Sequence Learningwith recurrent networks. The first approach is to predict what comes next in asequence, which is a language model in NLP. The second approach is to use asequence autoencoder, which reads the input sequence into a vector and predictsthe input sequence again. These two algorithms can be used as a “pretraining”algorithm for a later supervised sequence learning algorithm. In other words, theparameters obtained from the pretraining step can then be used as a starting pointfor other supervised training models. In our experiments, we find that long shortterm memory recurrent networks after pretrained with the two approaches becomemore stable to train and generalize better. With pretraining, we were able toachieve strong performance in many classification tasks, such as text classificationwith IMDB, DBpedia or image recognition in CIFAR-10."
"Structured Transforms for Small-Footprint Deep Learning. We consider the task of building compact deep learning pipelines suitable for deploymenton storage and power constrained mobile devices. We propose a uni-fied framework to learn a broad family of structured parameter matrices that arecharacterized by the notion of low displacement rank. Our structured transformsadmit fast function and gradient evaluation, and span a rich range of parametersharing configurations whose statistical modeling capacity can be explicitly tunedalong a continuum from structured to unstructured. Experimental results showthat these transforms can significantly accelerate inference and forward/backwardpasses during training, and offer superior accuracy-compactness-speed tradeoffsin comparison to a number of existing techniques. In keyword spotting applicationsin mobile speech recognition, our methods are much more effective thanstandard linear low-rank bottleneck layers and nearly retain the performance ofstate of the art models, while providing more than 3.5-fold compression."
"Rapidly Mixing Gibbs Sampling for a Class of Factor Graphs Using Hierarchy Width. Gibbs sampling on factor graphs is a widely used inference technique, which often produces good empirical results. Theoretical guarantees for its performance are weak: even for tree structured graphs, the mixing time of Gibbs may be exponential in the number of variables. To help understand the behavior of Gibbs sampling, we introduce a new (hyper)graph property, called hierarchy width. We show that under suitable conditions on the weights, bounded hierarchy width ensures polynomial mixing time.  Our study of hierarchy width is in part motivated by a class of factor graph templates, hierarchical templates, which have bounded hierarchy width—regardless of the data used to instantiate them. We demonstrate a rich application from natural language processing in which Gibbs sampling provably mixes rapidly and achieves accuracy that exceeds human volunteers."
"Interpolating Convex and Non-Convex Tensor Decompositions via the Subspace Norm. We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from its noisy observation. Previous work has shown a recovery guarantee with signal to noise ratio $O(n^{\ceil{K/2}/2})$ for recovering a $K$th order rank one tensor of size $n\times \cdots \times n$ by recursive unfolding. In this paper, we first improve this bound to $O(n^{K/4})$ by a much simpler approach, but with a more careful analysis. Then we propose a new norm called the \textit{subspace} norm, which is based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator. The imposed Kronecker structure allows us to show a nearly ideal $O(\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{H^{K-1}})$ bound, in which the parameter $H$ controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the subspace norm achieves the nearly ideal denoising performance even with $H=O(1)$."
"Sample Complexity Bounds for Iterative Stochastic Policy Optimization. This paper is concerned with robustness analysis of decision making under uncertainty. We consider a class of iterative stochastic policy optimization problems and analyze the resulting expected performance for each newly updated policy at each iteration. In particular, we employ concentration-of-measure inequalities to compute future expected cost and probability of constraint violation using empirical runs. A novel inequality bound is derived that accounts for the possibly unbounded change-of-measure likelihood ratio resulting from iterative policy adaptation. The bound serves as a high-confidence certificate for providing future performance or safety guarantees. The approach is illustrated with a simple robot control scenario and initial steps towards applications to challenging aerial vehicle navigation problems are presented."
"BinaryConnect: Training Deep Neural Networks with binary weights during propagations. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks, with the best results obtained with large training sets and large models. In the past, GPUs enabled these breakthroughs because of their greater computational speed. In the future, faster computation at both training and test time is likely to be crucial for further progress and for consumer applications on low-power devices. As a result, there is much interest in research and development of dedicated hardware for Deep Learning (DL). Binary weights, i.e., weights which are constrained to only two possible values (e.g. -1 or 1), would bring great benefits to specialized DL hardware by replacing many multiply-accumulate operations by simple accumulations, as multipliers are the most space and power-hungry components of the digital implementation of neural networks. We introduce BinaryConnect, a method which consists in training a DNN with binary weights during the forward and backward propagations, while retaining precision of the stored weights in which gradients are accumulated. Like other dropout schemes, we show that BinaryConnect acts as regularizer and we obtain near state-of-the-art results with BinaryConnect on the permutation-invariant MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN."
"Interactive Control of Diverse Complex Characters with Neural Networks. We present a method for training recurrent neural networks to act as near-optimal feedback controllers. It is able to generate stable and realistic behaviors for a range of dynamical systems and tasks -- swimming, flying, biped and quadruped walking with different body morphologies. It does not require motion capture or task-specific features or state machines. The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy. Essential features of the method include interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, injecting noise during training, training for unexpected changes in the task specification, and using the trajectory optimizer to obtain optimal feedback gains in addition to optimal actions."
"Submodular Hamming Metrics. We show that there is a largely unexplored class of functions (positive polymatroids) that can define proper discrete metrics over pairs of binary vectors and that are fairly tractable to optimize over.  By exploiting submodularity, we are able to give hardness results and approximation algorithms for optimizing over such metrics.  Additionally, we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of these metrics and associated algorithms on both a metric minimization task (a form of clustering) and also a metric maximization task (generating diverse k-best lists)."
"A Universal Primal-Dual Convex Optimization Framework. We propose a new primal-dual algorithmic framework for a prototypical constrained convex optimization template. The algorithmic instances of our framework are universal since they can automatically adapt to the unknown Holder continuity degree and constant within the dual formulation. They are also guaranteed to have optimal convergence rates in the objective residual and the feasibility gap for each Holder smoothness degree. In contrast to existing primal-dual algorithms, our framework avoids the proximity operator of the objective function. We instead leverage computationally cheaper, Fenchel-type operators, which are the main workhorses of the generalized conditional gradient (GCG)-type methods. In contrast to the GCG-type methods, our framework does not require the objective function to be differentiable, and can also process additional general linear inclusion constraints, while guarantees the convergence rate on the primal problem."
"Learning From Small Samples: An Analysis of Simple Decision Heuristics. Simple decision heuristics are models of human and animal behavior that use few pieces of information---perhaps only a single piece of information---and integrate the pieces in simple ways, for example, by considering them sequentially, one at a time, or by giving them equal weight. It is unknown how quickly these heuristics can be learned from experience. We show, analytically and empirically, that only a few training samples lead to substantial progress in learning. We focus on three families of heuristics: single-cue decision making, lexicographic decision making, and tallying. Our empirical analysis is the most extensive to date, employing 63 natural data sets on diverse subjects."
"Explore no more: Improved high-probability regret bounds for non-stochastic bandits. This work addresses the problem of regret minimization in non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problems, focusing on performance guarantees that hold with high probability. Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ times over $T$ rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit eXploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework.Finally, we conduct a simple experiment that illustrates the robustness of our implicit exploration technique."
"Fast and Memory Optimal Low-Rank Matrix Approximation. In this paper, we revisit the problem of constructing a near-optimal rank $k$ approximation of a matrix $M\in [0,1]^{m\times n}$ under the streaming data model where the columns of $M$ are revealed sequentially. We present SLA (Streaming Low-rank Approximation), an algorithm that is asymptotically accurate, when $k s_{k+1} (M) = o(\sqrt{mn})$ where $s_{k+1}(M)$ is the $(k+1)$-th largest singular value of $M$. This means that its average mean-square error converges to 0 as $m$ and $n$ grow large (i.e., $\|\hat{M}^{(k)}-M^{(k)} \|_F^2 = o(mn)$ with high probability, where $\hat{M}^{(k)}$ and $M^{(k)}$ denote the output of SLA and the optimal rank $k$ approximation of $M$, respectively). Our algorithm makes one pass on the data if the columns of $M$ are revealed in a random order, and two passes if the columns of $M$ arrive in an arbitrary order. To reduce its memory footprint and complexity, SLA uses random sparsification, and samples each entry of $M$ with a small probability $\delta$. In turn, SLA is memory optimal as its required memory space scales as $k(m+n)$, the dimension of its output. Furthermore, SLA is computationally efficient as it runs in $O(\delta  kmn)$ time (a constant number of operations is made for each observed entry of $M$), which can be as small as $O(k\log(m)^4 n)$ for an appropriate choice of $\delta$ and if $n\ge m$."
"Learnability of Influence in Networks. We establish PAC learnability of influence functions for three common influence models, namely, the Linear Threshold (LT), Independent Cascade (IC) and Voter models, and present concrete sample complexity results in each case. Our results for the LT model are based on interesting connections with neural networks; those for the IC model are based an interpretation of the influence function as an expectation over random draw of a subgraph and use covering number arguments; and those for the Voter model are based on a reduction to linear regression.  We show these results for the case in which the cascades are only partially observed and we do not see the time steps in which a node has been influenced.  We also provide efficient polynomial time learning algorithms for a setting with full observation, i.e. where the cascades also contain the time steps in which nodes are influenced."
"Learning Causal Graphs with Small Interventions. We consider the problem of learning causal networks with interventions, when each intervention is limited in size under Pearl's Structural Equation Model with independent errors (SEM-IE). The objective is to minimize the number of experiments to discover the causal directions of all the edges in a causal graph. Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case. In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics. We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized adaptive learning algorithms. For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number of interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new deterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton completely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an $\alpha$-approximation algorithm where $\alpha$ is the independence number of the graph.  We also show that there exist graph classes for which the sufficient number of experiments is close to the lower bound. In the other extreme, there are graph classes for which the required number of experiments is multiplicatively $\alpha$ away from our lower bound. In simulations, our algorithm almost always performs very close to the lower bound, while the approach based on separating systems for complete graphs is significantly worse for random chordal graphs."
"Information-theoretic lower bounds for convex optimization with erroneous oracles. We consider the problem of optimizing convex and concave functions with access to an erroneous zeroth-order oracle. In particular, for a given function $x \to f(x)$ we consider optimization when one is given access to absolute error oracles that return values in [f(x) - \epsilon,f(x)+\epsilon] or relative error oracles that return value in [(1+\epsilon)f(x), (1 +\epsilon)f (x)], for some \epsilon larger than 0. We show stark information theoretic impossibility results for minimizing convex functions and maximizing concave functions over polytopes in this model."
"Fixed-Length Poisson MRF: Adding Dependencies to the Multinomial. We propose a novel distribution that generalizes the Multinomial distribution to enable dependencies between dimensions. Our novel distribution is based on the parametric form of the Poisson MRF model [Yang et al., 2012] but is fundamentally different because of the domain restriction to a fixed-length vector like in a Multinomial where the number of trials is fixed or known. Thus, we propose the Fixed-Length Poisson MRF (LPMRF) distribution. We develop methods to estimate the likelihood and log partition function (i.e. the log normalizing constant), which was not developed for the Poisson MRF model. In addition, we propose novel mixture and topic models that use LPMRF as a base distribution and discuss the similarities and differences with previous topic models such as the recently proposed Admixture of Poisson MRFs [Inouye et al., 2014]. We show the effectiveness of our LPMRF distribution over Multinomial models by evaluating the test set perplexity on a dataset of abstracts and Wikipedia. Qualitatively, we show that the positive dependencies discovered by LPMRF are interesting and intuitive. Finally, we show that our algorithms are fast and have good scaling (code available online)."
"Large-Scale Bayesian Multi-Label Learning via Topic-Based Label Embeddings. We present a scalable Bayesian multi-label learning model based on learning low-dimensional label embeddings. Our model assumes that each label vector is generated as a weighted combination of a set of topics (each topic being a distribution over labels), where the combination weights (i.e., the embeddings) for each label vector are conditioned on the observed feature vector. This construction, coupled with a Bernoulli-Poisson link function for each label of the binary label vector, leads to a model with a computational cost that scales in the number of positive labels in the label matrix. This makes the model particularly appealing for real-world multi-label learning problems where the label matrix is usually very massive but highly sparse. Using a data-augmentation strategy leads to full local conjugacy in our model, facilitating simple and very efficient Gibbs sampling, as well as an Expectation Maximization algorithm for inference. Also, predicting the label vector at test time does not require doing an inference for the label embeddings and can be done in closed form. We report results on several benchmark data sets, comparing our model with various state-of-the art methods."
"The Self-Normalized Estimator for Counterfactual Learning. This paper identifies a severe problem of the counterfactual risk estimator typically used in batch learning from logged bandit feedback (BLBF), and proposes the use of an alternative estimator that avoids this problem.In the BLBF setting, the learner does not receive full-information feedback like in supervised learning, but observes feedback only for the actions taken by a historical policy.This makes BLBF algorithms particularly attractive for training online systems (e.g., ad placement, web search, recommendation) using their historical logs.The Counterfactual Risk Minimization (CRM) principle offers a general recipe for designing BLBF algorithms. It requires a counterfactual risk estimator, and virtually all existing works on BLBF have focused on a particular unbiased estimator.We show that this conventional estimator suffers from apropensity overfitting problem when used for learning over complex hypothesis spaces.We propose to replace the risk estimator with a self-normalized estimator, showing that it neatly avoids this problem.This naturally gives rise to a new learning algorithm -- Normalized Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (Norm-POEM) --for structured output prediction using linear rules.We evaluate the empirical effectiveness of Norm-POEM on severalmulti-label classification problems, finding that it consistently outperforms the conventional estimator."
"Fast Lifted MAP Inference via Partitioning. Recently, there has been growing interest in lifting MAP inference algorithms for Markov logic networks (MLNs). A key advantage of these lifted algorithms is that they have much smaller computational complexity than propositional algorithms when symmetries are present in the MLN and these symmetries can be detected using lifted inference rules. Unfortunately, lifted inference rules are sound but not complete and can often miss many symmetries. This is problematic because when symmetries cannot be exploited, lifted inference algorithms ground the MLN, and search for solutions in the much larger propositional space. In this paper, we present a novel approach, which cleverly introduces new symmetries at the time of grounding. Our main idea is to partition the ground atoms and force the inference algorithm to treat all atoms in each part as indistinguishable. We show that by systematically and carefully refining (and growing) the partitions, we can build advanced any-time and any-space MAP inference algorithms. Our experiments on several real-world datasets clearly show that our new algorithm is superior to previous approaches and often finds useful symmetries in the search space that existing lifted inference rules are unable to detect."
"Data Generation as Sequential Decision Making. We connect a broad class of generative models through their shared reliance on sequential decision making. Motivated by this view, we develop extensions to an existing model, and then explore the idea further in the context of data imputation -- perhaps the simplest setting in which to investigate the relation between unconditional and conditional generative modelling. We formulate data imputation as an MDP and develop models capable of representing effective policies for it. We construct the models using neural networks and train them using a form of guided policy search. Our models generate predictions through an iterative process of feedback and refinement. We show that this approach can learn effective policies for imputation problems of varying difficulty and across multiple datasets."
"On Elicitation Complexity. Elicitation is the study of statistics or properties which are computable via empirical risk minimization.  While several recent papers have approached the general question of which properties are elicitable, we suggest that this is the wrong question---all properties are elicitable by first eliciting the entire distribution or data set, and thus the important question is how elicitable.  Specifically, what is the minimum number of regression parameters needed to compute the property?Building on previous work, we introduce a new notion of elicitation complexity and lay the foundations for a calculus of elicitation.  We establish several general results and techniques for proving upper and lower bounds on elicitation complexity.  These results provide tight bounds for eliciting the Bayes risk of any loss, a large class of properties which includes spectral risk measures and several new properties of interest."
"Decomposition Bounds for Marginal MAP. Marginal MAP inference involves making MAP predictions in systems defined with latent variables or missing information. It is significantly more difficult than pure marginalization and MAP tasks, for which a large class of efficient and convergent variational algorithms, such as dual decomposition, exist.  In this work, we generalize dual decomposition to a generic powered-sum inference task, which includes marginal MAP, along with pure marginalization and MAP, as special cases.  Our method is based on a block coordinate descent algorithm on a new convex decomposition bound, that is guaranteed to converge monotonically, and can be parallelized efficiently.  We demonstrate our approach on various inference queries over real-world problems from the UAI approximate inference challenge, showing that our framework is faster and more reliable than previous methods."
"Discrete Rényi Classifiers. Consider the binary classification problem of predicting a target variable Y from a discrete feature vector X = (X1,...,Xd). When the probability distribution P(X,Y) is known, the optimal classifier, leading to the minimum misclassification rate, is given by the Maximum A-posteriori Probability (MAP) decision rule. However, in practice, estimating the complete joint distribution P(X,Y) is computationally and statistically impossible for large values of d. Therefore, an alternative approach is to first estimate some low order marginals of the joint probability distribution P(X,Y) and then design the classifier based on the estimated low order marginals. This approach is also helpful when the complete training data instances are not available due to privacy concerns. In this work, we consider the problem of designing the optimum classifier based on some estimated low order marginals of (X,Y). We prove that for a given set of marginals, the minimum Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R´enyi (HGR) correlation principle introduced in [1] leads to a randomized classification rule which is shown to have a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate of the optimal classifier. Then, we show that under a separability condition, the proposed algorithm is equivalent to a randomized linear regression approach which naturally results in a robust feature selection method selecting a subset of features having the maximum worst case HGR correlation with the target variable. Our theoretical upper-bound is similar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while the proposed algorithm has significant computational advantages since it only requires solving a least square optimization problem. Finally, we numerically compare our proposed algorithm with the DCC classifier and show that the proposed algorithm results in better misclassification rate over various UCI data repository datasets."
"A class of network models recoverable by spectral clustering. Finding communities in networks is a problem that remains difficult, in spite of the amount of attention it has recently received. The Stochastic Block-Model (SBM) is a generative model for graphs with communities for which, because of its simplicity, the theoretical understanding has advanced fast in recent years. In particular, there have been various results showing that simple versions of spectralclustering using the Normalized Laplacian of the graph can recoverthe communities almost perfectly with high probability. Here we show that essentially the same algorithm used for the SBM and for its extension called Degree-Corrected SBM, works on a wider class of Block-Models, which we call Preference Frame Models, with essentially the same guarantees. Moreover, the parametrization we introduce clearly exhibits the free parameters needed to specify this class of models, and results in bounds that expose with more clarity the parameters that control the recovery error in this model class."
"Skip-Thought Vectors. We describe an approach for unsupervised learning of a generic, distributed sentence encoder. Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice. We will make our encoder publicly available."
"Rate-Agnostic (Causal) Structure Learning. Causal structure learning from time series data is a major scientific challenge.  Existing algorithms assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly; more precisely, they assume that the system and measurement timescales are approximately equal. In many scientific domains, however, measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes.  Moreover, the size of the mismatch between timescales is often unknown. This paper provides three distinct causal structure learning algorithms, all of which discover all dynamic graphs that could explain the observed measurement data as arising from undersampling at some rate. That is, these algorithms all learn causal structure without assuming any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales; they are thus rate-agnostic. We apply these algorithms to data from simulations. The results provide insight into the challenge of undersampling."
"Principal Geodesic Analysis for Probability Measures under the Optimal Transport Metric. We consider in this work the space of probability measures $P(X)$ on a Hilbert space $X$ endowed with the 2-Wasserstein metric. Given a finite family of probability measures in $P(X)$, we propose an iterative approach to compute geodesic principal components that summarize efficiently that dataset. The 2-Wasserstein metric provides $P(X)$ with a Riemannian structure and associated concepts (Fr\'echet mean, geodesics, tangent vectors) which prove crucial to follow the intuitive approach laid out by standard principal component analysis. To make our approach feasible, we propose to use an alternative parameterization of geodesics proposed by \citet[\S 9.2]{ambrosio2006gradient}. These \textit{generalized} geodesics are parameterized with two velocity fields defined on the support of the Wasserstein mean of the data, each pointing towards an ending point of the generalized geodesic. The resulting optimization problem of finding principal components is solved by adapting a projected gradient descend method. Experiment results show the ability of the computed principal components to capture axes of variability on histograms and probability measures data."
"Consistent Multilabel Classification. Multilabel classification is rapidly developing as an important aspect of modern predictive modeling, motivating study of its theoretical aspects. To this end, we propose a framework for constructing and analyzing multilabel classification metrics which reveals novel results on a parametric form for population optimal classifiers, and additional insight into the role of label correlations. In particular, we show that for multilabel metrics constructed as instance-, micro- and macro-averages, the population optimal classifier can be decomposed into binary classifiers based on the marginal instance-conditional distribution of each label, with a weak association between labels via the threshold. Thus, our analysis extends the state of the art from a few known multilabel classification metrics such as Hamming loss, to a general framework applicable to many of the classification metrics in common use. Based on the population-optimal classifier, we propose a computationally efficient and general-purpose plug-in classification algorithm, and prove its consistency with respect to the metric of interest. Empirical results on synthetic and benchmark datasets are supportive of our theoretical findings."
"Parallel Predictive Entropy Search for Batch Global Optimization of Expensive Objective Functions. We develop \textit{parallel predictive entropy search} (PPES), a novel algorithm for Bayesian optimization of expensive black-box objective functions. At each iteration, PPES aims to select a \textit{batch} of points which will maximize the information gain about the global maximizer of the objective.  Well known strategies exist for suggesting a single evaluation point based on previous observations, while far fewer are known for selecting batches of points to evaluate in parallel. The few batch selection schemes that have been studied all resort to greedy methods to compute an optimal batch. To the best of our knowledge, PPES is the first non-greedy batch Bayesian optimization strategy. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in optimization performance on both synthetic and real world applications, including problems in machine learning, rocket science and robotics."
"Cornering Stationary and Restless Mixing Bandits with Remix-UCB. We study the restless bandit problem where arms are associated with stationary $\varphi$-mixing processes and where rewards are therefore dependent: the question that arises from this setting is that of carefully recovering some independence by `ignoring' the values of some rewards. As we shall see, the bandit problem we tackle requires us to address the exploration/exploitation/independence trade-off, which we do by considering the idea of a {\em waiting arm} in the new Remix-UCB algorithm, a generalization of Improved-UCB for the problem at hand, that we introduce. We provide a regret analysis for this bandit strategy; two noticeable features of Remix-UCB are that i) it reduces to the regular Improved-UCB when the $\varphi$-mixing coefficients are all $0$, i.e. when the i.i.d scenario is recovered, and ii) when $\varphi(n)=O(n^{-\alpha})$, it is able to ensure a controlled regret of order $\Ot\left(  \Delta_*^{(\alpha- 2)/\alpha} \log^{1/\alpha} T\right),$ where $\Delta_*$ encodes the distance between the best arm and the best suboptimal arm, even in the case when $\alpha<1$, i.e. the case when the $\varphi$-mixing coefficients {\em are not} summable."
"Semi-Supervised Factored Logistic Regression for High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Data. Imaging neuroscience links human behavior to aspects of brain biology in ever-increasing datasets. Existing neuroimaging methods typically perform either discovery of unknown neural structure or testing of neural structure associated with mental tasks. However, testing hypotheses on the neural correlates underlying larger sets of mental tasks necessitates adequate representations for the observations. We therefore propose to blend representation modelling and task classification into a unified statistical learning problem. A multinomial logistic regression is introduced that is constrained by factored coefficients and coupled with an autoencoder. We show that this approach yields more accurate and interpretable neural models of psychological tasks in a reference dataset, as well as better generalization to other datasets."
"Gaussian Process Random Fields. Gaussian processes have been successful in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning tasks, but their computational complexity has constrained practical applications. We introduce a new approximation for large-scale Gaussian processes, the Gaussian Process Random Field (GPRF), in which local GPs are coupled via pairwise potentials. The GPRF likelihood is a simple, tractable, and parallelizeable approximation to the full GP marginal likelihood, enabling latent variable modeling and hyperparameter selection on large datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic spatial data as well as a real-world application to seismic event location."
"M-Statistic for Kernel Change-Point Detection. Detecting the emergence of an abrupt change-point is a classic problem in statistics and machine learning. Kernel-based nonparametric statistics have been proposed for this task which make fewer assumptions on the distributions than traditional parametric approach. However, none of the existing kernel statistics has provided a computationally efficient way to characterize the extremal behavior of the statistic. Such characterization is crucial for setting the detection threshold, to control the significance level in the offline case as well as the average run length in the online case. In this paper we propose two related computationally efficient M-statistics for kernel-based change-point detection when the amount of background data is large. A novel theoretical result of the paper is the characterization of the tail probability of these statistics using a new technique based on change-of-measure. Such characterization provides us accurate detection thresholds for both offline and online cases in computationally efficient manner, without the need to resort to the more expensive simulations such as bootstrapping. We show that our methods perform well in both synthetic and real world data."
"Adaptive Online Learning. We propose a general framework for studying adaptive regret bounds in the online learning setting, subsuming model selection and data-dependent bounds. Given a data- or model-dependent bound we ask, “Does there exist some algorithm achieving this bound?” We show that modifications to recently introduced sequential complexity measures can be used to answer this question by providing sufficient conditions under which adaptive rates can be achieved. In particular each adaptive rate induces a set of so-called offset complexity measures, and obtaining small upper bounds on these quantities is sufficient to demonstrate achievability. A cornerstone of our analysis technique is the use of one-sided tail inequalities to bound suprema of offset random processes.Our framework recovers and improves a wide variety of adaptive bounds including quantile bounds, second order data-dependent bounds, and small loss bounds. In addition we derive a new type of adaptive bound for online linear optimization based on the spectral norm, as well as a new online PAC-Bayes theorem."
"A Universal Catalyst for First-Order Optimization. We introduce a generic scheme for accelerating first-order optimization methods in the sense of Nesterov, which builds upon a new analysis of the accelerated proximal point algorithm. Our approach consists of minimizing a convex objective by approximately solving a sequence of well-chosen auxiliary problems, leading to faster convergence. This strategy applies to a large class of algorithms, including gradient descent, block coordinate descent, SAG, SAGA, SDCA, SVRG, Finito/MISO, and their proximal variants.  For all of these methods, we provide acceleration and explicit support for non-strongly convex objectives. In addition to theoretical speed-up, we also show that acceleration is useful in practice, especially for ill-conditioned problems where we measure significant improvements."
"Inference for determinantal point processes without spectral knowledge. Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are point process models thatnaturally encode diversity between the points of agiven realization, through a positive definite kernel $K$. DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exactsampling or analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters ofkernel $K$ through likelihood-based inference is notstraightforward. First, the kernel that appears in thelikelihood is not $K$, but another kernel $L$ related to $K$ throughan often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is typically bypassed in machine learning bydirectly parametrizing the kernel $L$, at the price of someinterpretability of the model parameters. We follow this approachhere. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizingconstant, which takes the form of large determinant in the case of aDPP over a finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in thecase of a DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on the likelihood ofa DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike previous work, our bounds arecheap to evaluate since they do not rely on approximating the spectrumof a large matrix or an operator. Through usual arguments, these bounds thus yield cheap variationalinference and moderately expensive exact Markov chain Monte Carlo inference methods for DPPs."
"Kullback-Leibler Proximal Variational Inference. We propose a new variational inference method based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) proximal term. We make two contributions towards improving efficiency of variational inference. Firstly, we derive a KL proximal-point algorithm and show its equivalence to gradient descent with natural gradient in stochastic variational inference. Secondly, we use the proximal framework to derive efficient variational algorithms for non-conjugate models. We propose a splitting procedure to separate non-conjugate terms from conjugate ones. We then linearize the non-conjugate terms and show that the resulting subproblem admits a closed-form solution. Overall, our approach converts a non-conjugate model to subproblems that involve inference in well-known conjugate models. We apply our method to many models and derive generalizations for non-conjugate exponential family. Applications to real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms are easy to implement, fast to converge, perform well, and reduce computations."
"Semi-Proximal Mirror-Prox for Nonsmooth Composite Minimization. We propose a new first-order optimization algorithm to solve high-dimensional  non-smooth composite minimization problems. Typical examples of such problems have an objective that decomposes into a non-smooth empirical risk part and a non-smooth regularization penalty. The proposed algorithm, called Semi-Proximal Mirror-Prox, leverages the saddle point representation of one part of the objective while handling the other part of the objective via linear minimization over the domain. The algorithm stands in contrast with more classical proximal gradient algorithms with smoothing, which require the computation of proximal operators at each iteration and can therefore be impractical for high-dimensional problems. We establish the theoretical convergence rate of Semi-Proximal Mirror-Prox, which exhibits the optimal complexity bounds for the number of calls to linear minimization oracle. We present promising experimental results showing the interest of the approach in comparison to competing methods."
"LASSO with Non-linear Measurements is Equivalent to One With Linear Measurements. Consider estimating an unknown, but structured (e.g. sparse, low-rank, etc.), signal $x_0\in R^n$ from a vector $y\in R^m$ of measurements of the form $y_i=g_i(a_i^Tx_0)$, where the $a_i$'s are the rows of a known measurement matrix $A$, and, $g$ is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and random link-function. Such measurement functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlinearities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., $g_i(x)=sign(x+z_i)$, corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate $x_0$ via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., $\hat x=\arg\min_{x}\|y-Ax_0\|_2+\lambda f(x)$ for some regularization parameter $\lambda >0$ and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer $f$ that promotes the structure of $x_0$, e.g. $\ell_1$-norm, nuclear-norm. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function $g$, both Brillinger and Plan and Vershynin have shown that, when the entries of $A$ are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of $x_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\mu$, which only depends on $g$. In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions for $\|\hat x-\mu x_0\|_2$, for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when $m$ and $n$ grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear $y_i=\mu a_i^Tx_0+\sigma z_i$, with $\mu=E[\gamma g(\gamma)]$ and $\sigma^2=E[(g(\gamma)-\mu\gamma)^2]$, and, $\gamma$ standard normal. The derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the optimal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer."
"From random walks to distances on unweighted graphs. Large unweighted directed graphs are commonly used to capture relations between entities. A fundamental problem in the analysis of such networks is to properly define the similarity or dissimilarity between any two vertices. Despite the significance of this problem, statistical characterization of the proposed metrics has been limited.We introduce and develop a class of techniques for analyzing random walks on graphs using stochastic calculus. Using these techniques we generalize results on the degeneracy of hitting times and analyze a metric based on the Laplace transformed hitting time (LTHT). The metric serves as a natural, provably well-behaved alternative to the expected hitting time. We establish a general correspondence between hitting times of the Brownian motion and analogous hitting times on the graph. We show that the LTHT is consistent with respect to the underlying metric of a geometric graph, preserves clustering tendency, and remains robust against random addition of non-geometric edges. Tests on simulated and real-world data show that the LTHT matches theoretical predictions and outperforms alternatives."
"Bayesian dark knowledge. We consider the problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for deep neural networks, which is important in problem settings where we may have little data, and/ or where we need accurate posterior predictive densities p(y|x, D), e.g., for applications involving bandits or active learning. One simple approach to this is to use online Monte Carlo methods, such as SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics). Unfortunately, such a method needs to store many copies of the parameters (which wastes memory), and needs to make predictions using many versions of the model (which wastes time).We describe a method for “distilling” a Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior predictive density into a more compact form, namely a single deep neural network. We compare to two very recent approaches to Bayesian neural networks, namely an approach based on expectation propagation [HLA15] and an approach based on variational Bayes [BCKW15]. Our method performs better than both of these, is much simpler to implement, and uses less computation at test time."
"Matrix Completion with Noisy Side Information. We study matrix completion problem with side information.  Side information has been considered in several matrix completion applications, and is generally shown to be useful empirically.  Recently, Xu et al. studied the effect of side information for matrix completion under a theoretical viewpoint, showing that sample complexity can be significantly reduced given completely clean features.  However, since in reality most given features are noisy or even weakly informative, how to develop a general model to handle general feature set, and how much the noisy features can help matrix recovery in theory, is still an important issue to investigate. In this paper, we propose a novel model that balances between features and observations simultaneously, enabling us to leverage feature information yet to be robust to feature noise.  Moreover, we study the effectof general features in theory, and show that by using our model, the sample complexity can still be lower than matrix completion as long as features are sufficiently informative. This result provides a theoretical insight of usefulness for general side information.  Finally, we consider synthetic data and two real applications - relationship prediction and semi-supervised clustering, showing that our model outperforms other methods for matrix completion with features both in theory and practice."
"Dependent Multinomial Models Made Easy: Stick-Breaking with the Polya-gamma Augmentation. Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions. For example, nucleotides in a DNA sequence, children's names in a given state and year, and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions.  In all of these cases, we expect some form of dependency between the draws: the nucleotide at one position in the DNA strand may depend on the preceding nucleotides, children's names are highly correlated from year to year, and topics in text may be correlated and dynamic.  These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation.  Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in P\'{o}lya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead."
"On-the-Job Learning with Bayesian Decision Theory. Our goal is to deploy a high-accuracy system starting with zero training examples. We consider an “on-the-job” setting, where as inputs arrive, we use real-time crowdsourcing to resolve uncertainty where needed and output our prediction when confident. As the model improves over time, the reliance on crowdsourcing queries decreases. We cast our setting as a stochastic game based on Bayesian decision theory, which allows us to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. Computing the optimal policy is intractable, so we develop an approximation based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. We tested our approach on three datasets-- named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification. On the NER task we obtained more than an order of magnitude reduction in cost compared to full human annotation, while boosting performance relative to the expert provided labels. We also achieve a 8% F1 improvement over having a single human label the whole set, and a 28% F1 improvement over online learning."
"Calibrated Structured Prediction. In user-facing applications, displaying calibrated confidence measures---probabilities that correspond to true frequency---can be as important as obtaining high accuracy. We are interested in calibration for structured prediction problems such as speech recognition, optical character recognition, and medical diagnosis. Structured prediction presents new challenges for calibration: the output space is large, and users may issue many types of probability queries (e.g., marginals) on the structured output. We extend the notion of calibration so as to handle various subtleties pertaining to the structured setting,  and then provide a simple recalibration method that trains a binary classifier to predict probabilities of interest. We explore a range of features appropriate for structured recalibration, and demonstrate their efficacy on three real-world datasets."
"Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models. Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied for many recognition problems in machine learning and computer vision. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function very well when large number of training data is provided, the lack of probabilistic inference of the current supervised deep learning methods makes it difficult to model a complex structured output representations. In this work, we develop a scalable deep conditional generative model for structured output variables using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows a fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build a robust structured prediction algorithms, such as recurrent prediction network architecture, input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction training methods. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic output representations using stochastic inference. Furthermore, the proposed schemes in training methods and architecture design were complimentary, which leads to achieve strong pixel-level object segmentation and semantic labeling performance on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 and the subset of Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset."
"Time-Sensitive Recommendation From Recurrent User Activities. By making personalized suggestions, a recommender system is playing a crucial role in improving the engagement of users in modern web-services. However, most recommendation algorithms do not explicitly take into account the temporal behavior and the recurrent activities of users. Two central but less explored questions are how to recommend the most desirable item \emph{at the right moment}, and how to predict \emph{the next returning time} of a user to a service. To address these questions, we propose a novel framework which connects self-exciting point processes and low-rank models to capture the recurrent temporal patterns in a large collection of user-item consumption pairs. We show that the parameters of the model can be estimated via a convex optimization, and furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm that maintains $O(1 / \epsilon)$ convergence rate, scales up to problems with millions of user-item pairs and thousands of millions of temporal events. Compared to other state-of-the-arts in both synthetic and real datasets, our model achieves superb predictive performance in the two time-sensitive recommendation questions. Finally, we point out that our formulation can incorporate other extra context information of users, such as profile, textual and spatial features."
"Learning Stationary Time Series using Gaussian Processes with Nonparametric Kernels. We introduce the Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM), a two-stage nonparametric generative procedure to model stationary signals as the convolution between a continuous-time white-noise process and a continuous-time linear filter drawn from Gaussian process. The GPCM is a continuous-time nonparametric-window moving average process and, conditionally, is itself a Gaussian process with a nonparametric kernel defined in a probabilistic fashion. The generative model can be equivalently considered in the frequency domain, where the power spectral density of the signal is specified using a Gaussian process. One of the main contributions of the paper is to develop a novel variational free-energy approach based on inter-domain inducing variables that efficiently learns the continuous-time linear filter and infers the driving white-noise process. In turn, this scheme provides closed-form probabilistic estimates of the covariance kernel and the noise-free signal both in denoising and prediction scenarios. Additionally, the variational inference procedure provides closed-form expressions for the approximate posterior of the spectral density given the observed data, leading to new Bayesian nonparametric  approaches to spectrum estimation. The proposed GPCM is validated using synthetic and real-world signals."
"A Market Framework for Eliciting Private Data. We propose a mechanism for purchasing information from a sequence of participants.The participants may simply hold data points they wish to sell, or may have more sophisticated information; either way, they are incentivized to participate as long as they believe their data points are representative or their information will improve the mechanism's future prediction on a test set.The mechanism, which draws on the principles of prediction markets, has a bounded budget and minimizes generalization error for Bregman divergence loss functions.We then show how to modify this mechanism to preserve the privacy of participants' information: At any given time, the current prices and predictions of the mechanism reveal almost no information about any one participant, yet in total over all participants, information is accurately aggregated."
"Lifted Inference Rules With Constraints. Lifted inference rules exploit symmetries for fast reasoning in statistical rela-tional models. Computational complexity of these rules is highly dependent onthe choice of the constraint language they operate on and therefore coming upwith the right kind of representation is critical to the success of lifted inference.In this paper, we propose a new constraint language, called setineq, which allowssubset, equality and inequality constraints, to represent substitutions over the vari-ables in the theory. Our constraint formulation is strictly more expressive thanexisting representations, yet easy to operate on. We reformulate the three mainlifting rules: decomposer, generalized binomial and the recently proposed singleoccurrence for MAP inference, to work with our constraint representation. Exper-iments on benchmark MLNs for exact and sampling based inference demonstratethe effectiveness of our approach over several other existing techniques."
"Gradient Estimation Using Stochastic Computation Graphs. In a variety of problems originating in supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, the loss function is defined by an expectation over a collection of random variables, which might be part of a probabilistic model or the external world. Estimating the gradient of this loss function, using samples, lies at the core of gradient-based learning algorithms for these problems. We introduce the formalism of stochastic computation graphs--directed acyclic graphs that include both deterministic functions and conditional probability distributions and describe how to easily and automatically derive an unbiased estimator of the loss function's gradient. The resulting algorithm for computing the gradient estimator is a simple modification of the standard backpropagation algorithm. The generic scheme we propose unifies estimators derived in variety of prior work, along with variance-reduction techniques therein. It could assist researchers in developing intricate models involving a combination of stochastic and deterministic operations, enabling, for example, attention, memory, and control actions."
"Model-Based Relative Entropy Stochastic Search. Stochastic search algorithms are general black-box optimizers. Due to their ease of use and their generality, they have recently also gained a lot of attention in operations research, machine learning and policy search. Yet, these algorithms require a lot of evaluations of the objective, scale poorly with the problem dimension, are affected by highly noisy objective functions and may converge prematurely. To alleviate these problems, we introduce a new surrogate-based stochastic search approach. We learn simple, quadratic surrogate models of the objective function. As the quality of such a quadratic approximation is limited, we do not greedily exploit the learned models. The algorithm can be misled by an inaccurate optimum introduced by the surrogate. Instead, we use information theoretic constraints to bound the `distance' between the new and old data distribution while maximizing the objective function. Additionally the new method is able to sustain the exploration of the search distribution to avoid premature convergence. We compare our method with state of art black-box optimization methods on standard uni-modal and multi-modal optimization functions, on simulated planar robot tasks and a complex robot ball throwing task.The proposed method considerably outperforms the existing approaches."
"Semi-supervised Learning with Ladder Networks. We combine supervised learning with unsupervised learning in deep neural networks. The proposed model is trained to simultaneously minimize the sum of supervised and unsupervised cost functions by backpropagation, avoiding the need for layer-wise pre-training. Our work builds on top of the Ladder network proposed by Valpola (2015) which we extend by combining the model with supervision. We show that the resulting model reaches state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised MNIST and CIFAR-10 classification in addition to permutation-invariant MNIST classification with all labels."
"Embedding Inference for Structured Multilabel Prediction. A key bottleneck in structured output prediction is the need for inference during training and testing, usually requiring some form of dynamic programming.  Rather than using approximate inference or tailoring a specialized inference method for a particular structure---standard responses to the scaling challenge---we propose to embed prediction constraints directly into the learned representation.  By eliminating the need for explicit inference a more scalable approach to structured output prediction can be achieved, particularly at test time.  We demonstrate the idea for multi-label prediction under subsumption and mutual exclusion constraints,  where a relationship to maximum margin structured output prediction can be established.  Experiments demonstrate that the benefits of structured output training can still be realized even after inference has been eliminated."
"Copula variational inference. We develop a general variational inference method that preserves dependency among the latent variables. Our method uses copulas to augment the families of distributions used in mean-field and structured approximations. Copulas model the dependency that is not captured by the original variational distribution, and thus the augmented variational family guarantees better approximations to the posterior. With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables."
"Recursive Training of 2D-3D Convolutional Networks for Neuronal Boundary Prediction. Efforts to automate the reconstruction of neural circuits from 3D electron microscopic (EM) brain images are critical for the field of connectomics. An important computation for reconstruction is the detection of neuronal boundaries. Images acquired by serial section EM, a leading 3D EM technique, are highly anisotropic, with inferior quality along the third dimension. For such images, the 2D max-pooling convolutional network has set the standard for performance at boundary detection. Here we achieve a substantial gain in accuracy through three innovations. Following the trend towards deeper networks for object recognition, we use a much deeper network than previously employed for boundary detection. Second, we incorporate 3D as well as 2D filters, to enable computations that use 3D context. Finally, we adopt a recursively trained architecture in which a first network generates a preliminary boundary map that is provided as input along with the original image to a second network that generates a final boundary map. Backpropagation training is accelerated by ZNN, a new implementation of 3D convolutional networks that uses multicore CPU parallelism for speed. Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture could be more generally applicable to other types of anisotropic 3D images, including video, and our recursive framework for any image labeling problem."
"A Dual Augmented Block Minimization Framework for Learning with Limited Memory. In past few years, several techniques have been proposed for training of linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) in limited-memory setting, where a dual block-coordinate descent (dual-BCD) method was used to balance cost spent on I/O and computation. In this paper, we consider the more general setting of regularized \emph{Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)} when data cannot fit into memory. In particular, we generalize the existing block minimization framework based on strong duality and \emph{Augmented Lagrangian} technique to achieve global convergence for ERM with arbitrary convex loss function and regularizer. The block minimization framework is flexible in the sense that, given a solver working under sufficient memory, one can integrate it with the framework to obtain a solver globally convergent under limited-memory condition. We conduct experiments on L1-regularized classification and regression problems to corroborate our convergence theory and compare the proposed framework to  algorithms adopted from online and distributed settings, which shows superiority of the proposed approach on data of size ten times larger than the memory capacity."
"Optimal Testing for Properties of Distributions. Given samples from an unknown  distribution, p, is it possible to distinguish whether p belongs to some class of distributions C versus p being far from every distribution in C? This fundamental question has receivedtremendous attention in Statistics, albeit focusing onasymptotic analysis, as well as in Computer Science, wherethe emphasis has been on small sample size and computationalcomplexity. Nevertheless, even for basic classes ofdistributions such as monotone, log-concave, unimodal, and monotone hazard rate, the optimal sample complexity is unknown.We provide a general approach via which we obtain sample-optimal and computationally efficient testers for all these distribution families. At the core of our approach is an algorithm which solves the following problem:Given samplesfrom an unknown distribution p, and a known distribution q, are p and q close in Chi^2-distance, or far in total variation distance?The optimality of all testers is established by providing matching lower bounds. Finally, a necessary building block for our tester and important byproduct of our work are the first known computationally efficient proper learners for discretelog-concave and monotone hazard rate distributions. We exhibit the efficacy of our testers via experimental analysis."
"Efficient Learning of Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Models for Disease Progression. The Continuous-Time Hidden Markov Model (CT-HMM) is an attractive approach to modeling disease progression due to its ability to describe noisy observations arriving irregularly in time. However, the lack of an efficient parameter learning algorithm for CT-HMM restricts its use to very small models or requires unrealistic constraints on the state transitions. In this paper, we present the first complete characterization of efficient EM-based learning methods for CT-HMM models. We demonstrate that the learning problem consists of two challenges: the estimation of posterior state probabilities and the computation of end-state conditioned statistics. We solve the first challenge by reformulating the estimation problem in terms of an equivalent discrete time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov model. The second challenge is addressed by adapting three approaches from the continuous time Markov chain literature to the CT-HMM domain. We demonstrate the use of CT-HMMs with more than 100 states to visualize and predict disease progression using a glaucoma dataset and an Alzheimer's disease dataset."
Expectation Particle Belief Propagation. We propose an original particle-based implementation of the Loopy Belief Propagation (LPB) algorithm for pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF) on a continuous state space. The algorithm constructs adaptively efficient proposal distributions approximating the local beliefs  at each note of the MRF. This is achieved by considering proposal distributions in the exponential family whose parameters are updated iterately in an Expectation Propagation (EP) framework. The proposed particle scheme provides consistent estimation of the LBP marginals as the number of particles increases. We demonstrate that it provides more accurate results than the Particle Belief Propagation (PBP) algorithm of Ihler and McAllester (2009) at a fraction of the computational cost and is additionally more robust empirically. The computational complexity of our algorithm at each iteration is quadratic in the number of particles. We also propose an accelerated implementation with sub-quadratic computational complexity which still provides consistent estimates of the loopy BP marginal distributions and performs almost as well as the original procedure.
"Latent Bayesian melding for integrating individual and population models. In many statistical problems, a more coarse-grained model may be suitable for population-level behaviour,  whereas a more detailed model is appropriate for accurate modelling of individual behaviour. This raises the question of how to integrate both types of models. Methods such as posterior regularization follow the idea of generalized moment matching, in that they allow matchingexpectations between two models, but sometimes both models are most conveniently expressed as latent variable models. We propose latent Bayesian melding, which is motivated by averaging the distributions over populations statistics of both the individual-level and the population-level models under a logarithmic opinion pool framework. In a case study on electricity disaggregation, which is a type of single-channel blind source separation problem, we show that latent Bayesian melding leads to significantly more accurate predictions than an approach based solely on generalized moment matching."
"Distributionally Robust Logistic Regression. This paper proposes a distributionally robust approach to logistic regression. We use the Wasserstein distance to construct a ball in the space of probability distributions centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples. If the radius of this Wasserstein ball is chosen judiciously, we can guarantee that it contains the unknown data-generating distribution with high confidence. We then formulate a distributionally robust logistic regression model that minimizes a worst-case expected logloss function, where the worst case is taken over all distributions in the Wasserstein ball. We prove that this optimization problem admits a tractable reformulation and encapsulates the classical as well as the popular regularized logistic regression problems as special cases. We further propose a distributionally robust approach based on Wasserstein balls to compute upper and lower confidence bounds on the misclassification probability of the resulting classifier. These bounds are given by the optimal values of two highly tractable linear programs. We validate our theoretical out-of-sample guarantees through simulated and empirical experiments."
"Variational Dropout and the Local Reparameterization Trick. We explore an as yet unexploited opportunity for drastically improving the efficiency of stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) with global model parameters. Regular SGVB estimators rely on sampling of parameters once per minibatch of data, and have variance that is constant w.r.t. the minibatch size. The efficiency of such estimators can be drastically improved upon by translating uncertainty about global parameters into local noise that is independent across datapoints in the minibatch. Such reparameterizations with local noise can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence.We find an important connection with regularization by dropout: the original Gaussian dropout objective corresponds to SGVB with local noise, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance. Our method allows inference of more flexibly parameterized posteriors; specifically, we propose \emph{variational dropout}, a generalization of Gaussian dropout, but with a more flexibly parameterized posterior, often leading to better generalization. The method is demonstrated through several experiments."
